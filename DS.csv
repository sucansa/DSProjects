2,"The King, the Mice and the Cheese by Nancy Gurney is an excellent children's book.  It is one that I well remember from my own childhood and purchased for my daughter who loves it. It is about a king who has trouble with rude mice eating his cheese. He consults his wise men and they suggest cats to chase away the mice. The cats become a nuisance, so the wise men recommend the king bring in dogs to chase the cats away.  The cycle goes on until the mice are finally brought back to chase away the elephants, brought in to chase away the lions that'd chased away the dogs. The story ends in compromise and friendship between the mice and the king.  The story also teaches cause and effect relationships. The pictures that accompany the story are humorous and memorable.  I was thrilled to discover that it is back in print.  I *highly* recommend it for children ages 2 to 7.",0,"The King, the Mice and the Cheese by Nancy Gurney is an excellent children's book.

9,"I like my coffee hot; borderline scorching but drinkable.  About 10 years ago I purchased several Avantro coffee mugs that are very similar to these.  Those have been able to keep my coffee at my preferred drinking temperature for well over 4 hours even on the coldest of days.  I work outside so hot coffee is crucial in these nasty New England winters. Well, day one with this new mug and I am quite disappointed.  This mug barely kept my coffee warm for an hour.  That is quite unacceptable seeing as how this company is the one that bought out Avantro.",0,"I like my coffee hot; borderline scorching but drinkable.

12,"This mug does only a fair job of keeping coffee hot.  It will absolutely NOT protect your shirt, pants, carseat, or anything else from spills and drips!  The lid does help to keep the coffee hot in that without the lid it is exposed to the air.  That slight benefit and it's attractive appearance are the only advantages I found.  If you have NO concern about leaking/dripping, this mug is sufficient, however, the Contigo Autoseal West Loop is a much better product, and for essentially the same price.  I have returned my Timolino PABLO-46GREmug and purchased 2 Contigo Autoseal West Loop thermal mugs in 2 of the many colors available (I like lilac & gunmetal).  This Timolino thermal mug, in my opinion, should cost only $10 due to it propensity to leak!",0,"This mug does only a fair job of keeping coffee hot.

16,"Over and over the king has problems.  Fortunately, he has wise men to help him solve his problems.  Unfortunately, his wise men turn one problem into another problem.  So, on top of all his other problems his wise men are a problem too. Who wants mice all over the place; naughty mice at that?

23,I have played the old anno 1701 AND 1503.  this game looks great but is more complex than the previous versions of the game. I found a lot of things lacking such as the sources of power and an inability to store energy with batteries or regenertive fuel cells as buildings in the game need power. Trade is about the same. My main beef with this it requires an internet connection. Other than that it has wonderful artistry and graphics. It is the same as anno 1701 but set in a future world where global warmming as flood the land and resource scarcity has sent human kind to look to the deep ocean for valuable minerals. I recoment the deep ocean expansion or complete if you get this. I found the ai instructor a little corny but other than that the game has some real polish. I wrote my 2 cents worth on suggestions on anno 2070 wiki and you can read 3 pages on that for game ideas I had.,0,I have played the old anno 1701 AND 1503.  this game looks great but is more complex than the previous versions of the game.

People are not as stupid as you think, and will simply find a different game to fill their time with and throw their money at if their freedoms are inhibited by your software.

41,"I felt like my son's kindergarten class didn't cover telling time very effectively and when I discovered he could only tell time on the hour (and called it 'twelve sixty' instead of 'twelve o'clock') I ordered this clock for him. Within 2 days of MAYBE 5 minutes per day of me explaining how the clock worked, he could tell time to the exact MINUTE and get it perfectly right every time! My boy is CRAZY about gears and the fact that this clock has two internal gears showing through a clear window grabbed his eyes and riveted his attention the second he saw it. He immediately wrestled the clock from my hands to play with it. Since playing is learning, I let him have it. The hands are cleverly geared to where the hour hand will advance when the minute hand is turned but the hands are not ""locked"" so you can move the minute and hour hand to wherever you want them to be. This is VERY helpful when you are first teaching time. I could place the hour hand EXACTLY on 12 and the minute hand EXACTLY on the 6 to help him identify 12:30. With other clocks the hour & minute hands lock so when the minute hand is on the half hour, the hour hand is between the 12 and 1 and it won't let you move it forwards or back. I LOVE LOVE LOVE that this clock does not lock like that and lets me move the hands completely independently or in tandem as I choose! Sure, he can see that when he moves the minute hand, the hour progresses on its own towards the next hour number and NOW he understands how to read a clock when the hour hand is halfway between two numbers but before he was confused by the hand being between the 12 and 1 and would guess at the time (sixty o'five?) Another thing I love about this clock is that around the outside edge of the numbers is a blue painted ""gear"" circle shape (shown as a green outer ring in the preview) that has the five minute increments written beside every number and the ""teeth"" of the gear mark the individual minutes in between each 5 minute number. He latched on to the gear concept instantly so explaining to him that each gear tooth represented one minute made learning to tell time a SNAP. Literally, I explained the very basics and as he played with the clock, he got it. Easiest thing I have EVER taught him thanks to this little Judy clock! If you feel like maybe you can't put your understanding of telling time into words, don't worry! The little booklet that comes with the clock gives you step-by-step teaching sentences you can repeat to your child and even covers what 'quarter hour' means. The booklet is about 5x7 inches with some small coloring pages, a few short question worksheets and time telling challenges, etc. I started to use the booklet and got to the part about where I explain quarter hours (the clock is like a pizza and you can slice the time into 4 equal parts of 15 minutes each) and my son was hushing me up because he suddenly understood telling time and wanted to make the clock read the same time as our digital microwave clock. This was in the first five minutes of the thing being in his hands and he did it! If you have a child who is a tactile-kinesthetic learner, has had difficulty telling time or you just want to make homework a million times easier, get this clock! (And I suggest this style - 'My Own Little Judy Clock' that has non-locking hands). Confusing homework sheets with bland black-and-white clock images become soooo much easier to understand when your child can hold a clock, move the hands around, count by fives along the outer minute rim or count the individual teeth if necessary to answer math questions. If only all of teaching was this easy! Clock is yellow plastic with plastic hands and internal gears. It isn't flimsy but could crack if stepped on. Hands are not brittle and have some give to them, which is nice because they get much more handling. 5 inches tall by 5 inches wide with little plastic easel stand in the back for upright display.

My two-year-old LOVES this book, and fills in the words every time we get to words like ""king"" ""mice"" ""cheese"" ""lion"", etc.  He really has no idea what the story teaches, but he loves to read it with me, and that's the key to a great kid's book."

This game makes Codemasters the king of graphics realism. BUY THIS GAME !!!!! December 6, 2011  I saw my review of the Internet and wanted to update it for you. First of all anyone with this program, BUY the extra environments and cars. It is money well spent and a first class job of an addon. I wanted everyone to know that this program is still the top of the heap in graphics. I bought Battlefield 3 and it is good, but not the standard of the ego 2 engine. Codemasters are the king of graphics so far and I find that the more realism a game has, the more adicted you will become. No other program running with all variables to the max, looks like Dirt 3.

52,"Update June 2013: Deeply disappointed at the lack of a non-linear open-world environment. But its the restrictive QTE gameplay and final-kill cut-scenes that kill the game for me. I loath enforced QTE. When a mission goes awry and you're trying to escape a hail of bullets, if you happen to brush past an assailant you can't escape QTE mode. Meanwhile you're being shot at from all sides. It just lacks the sense of freedom that Blood Money had, and it takes you out of the whole gaming experience placing you instead into a second-rate interactive movie. As a loyal fan of the Hitman franchise, I waited years for this. I would have loved if they had added driving into the game in order to rival Saints Row or the GTA series etc. What they did add took away from the game. For instance they should have kept the semi-open-worlds of Blood Money and build-on those beautiful sets, maps and locations. I would have loved if Hitman had been as open as Skyrim. Overall Dishonored's gameplay is a far superior hitman style gaming experience. But I wish they had had Bioshock Infinite's breathtaking visuals in that particular game. ================================================================== Wow after all these years waiting-- this is it.....?!!! I am still a huge fan of Blood Money. The fact that you can now play it again online for free is a huge plus! To play, all you have to do is watch a 30-second ad on mute and you get sufficient time to play a level. Who can complain about that? But this, what took them so long to produce a bad cousin of Metal Gear Solid?! Intuition....? STOP! STOP! STOP Please let me use my own intuition! And what is it with the game constantly talking to you like you're an idiot? All this serves to do is kill any the sense of atmosphere, tension and suspense! You want to know how bad this game is....? They use cut scenes for the final kill, thus killing any sense of pay off! And you can't even skip through the intro level! Hello? This was a cult game... So lots of people know how to play it and don't need this hand holding to be mandatory! The graphics too are little improvement over Blood Money, and are definitely a let down compared to the current generation of games. There is less of a non-linear feel about this version also. Now you're not quite tied to a string as you walk through levels, but its sub par compared with the freedom of its predecessor IMHO. Such a shame, such a shame. But good for me as I embark on a career in Video Game Design.

This is a book that can be enjoyed by people of any age. It is a wonderful introduction to poetry for children, yet it is not a silly children's book. It is a book full of some of the most beautiful and captivating poetry in the English language. I grew up with this book, and learned to love literature and poetry, and the magical world between the covers of a book. Oh! What flights of imagination I went on, reading this lovely book. When I got married, my husband quoted ""Lochinvar"" from memory, substituting his own name for the last word in the Lochinvar poem! I was so surprised, and everyone cracked up laughing. The reason I knew this poem by Sir Walter Scott was because of this book. ""Tiger, Tiger, burning bright, in the forests of the night ..."" - ""The Highwayman came riding, riding, riding ..."" The Fish - ""... And I let the fish go."" Kentucky Belle. The Battle of Bunker Hill. Wynken, Blynken and Nod. Short, funny poems by Ogden Nash. The Blind Men and the Elephant. Abou Ben Adhem - may his tribe increase! So many wonderful poems are in this book. My old book had fallen apart. I work at a school where bookbinding classes were taught. I brought my book in, and got it fixed. Now, just last week, although I never got to have children myself, life has given me the amazing gift of two little great granddaughters, ages five and eight. What better gift for them than this book, where they will be able to be enchanted by poetry as I was, to grow with it, and they can read the poem that great-grandpa recited by heart after he got married for the second time, way back before they were born.

55,"I will open with the Pros: Replayability - It's Hitman. What did you expect? You can go back and replay missions over and over to try for a cleaner, quicker kill or just fly right through it in a weekend like I did. Length of game - Do not listen to reviews such as Xbox Official Magazine saying it is a lengthy game. I finished it in one weekend. Friday night, Sat and Sunday. I would estimate around 10-12 hours solid play. BUT..If you go back and replay the missions for a better score, then it can drag out much further. But like I said, to play through and complete the tasks, it is not a long game. Story - Not bad at all. A few plot holes made me scratch my head but not bad. Overall Graphics - Better than the old Hitman games but nothing at all like cut scenes. Don't confuse cut scenes in the trailers as gameplay. Character dev - Although they give you a little info on specific targets, it didn't seem worth the effort to look any deeper into their back story. I just went forth on a killing spree. You point me in that direction? Here I go. There's no option to ever take a person into custody and question them. You kill anyone who you are pointed at. Hand to hand - They kept it simple. between space bar, ""Q, W or E"" were your controls to hit when it told you to hit that key. It wasn't hard to do hand to hand. It wasn't 100% awesome like Batman but it was pretty good. Cons: OMG why did all the people in close-up cut scenes talk with all their teeth showing? It really got annoying. I have never in my life met a person who talks like that. Also, the timing of the voice acting was bad. Serious delays in dialogue had me thinking the conversation was over then it started up again. So, voice acting wasn't bad, but developers did a poor job clipping it. Graphics - In regards to clipping, I would sometimes get blocked by phantom walls while sneaking up steps. I had to walk back and forth until it let me pass. Also, it would say there was a key point right in front of me (blinking sonar circles) and there was nothing there. No desk, nothing to pick up and it was floating in the air. More developer issues. (Minor Spoiler) Don't read if you can't take hints. Sheer ease of killing other professional hitmen was a let down. I couldn't believe how easy it was to kill hired professionals. Professional Edition: Do not waste your money. I got some weapons you can't even use in the game. It gives you the loadout at the begining and the weapons around the map are all based off that part of the game. No point in having access to the additional weapons. Sniper challenge is ONE challenge. I beat it hands down and it never took me to a new challenge. It just lets you do the same challenge over and over. All in all, it's a good game discounted at 1/2 price or lower. Don't waste your $ on the Pro Edition.",1,"I will open with the Pros: Replayability - It's Hitman. What did you expect?

The visuals are vastly improved from Blood Money of course, and I appreciate their allowing me to play with my gamepad. Some have criticized the fact that this game has ""too much story"" in it.

84,"DiRT 2 was like this.  I'm becoming more & more suspicious of games like this that require a continuous open Internet to play.  It just seems like bait set out for some young naive prey to fall for.  Does anyone honestly believe that personal information is collected for no particular reason?  I don't care what they say publicly.  Any assurances of privacy protection are quite hollow without close oversight, and nobody's looking.  It's quite a different thing to knowingly step out into a multiplayer server where you know you're being tracked, but this type of continuous spying is something more.  That aside, this carrot on a stick has more problems than just security. CONS - Requires open Internet (Windows Live) to play.  Annoying interface.  Continuous reminders to upload and download things you already selected not to do.  Most settings don't keep between sessions.  Setting up a race takes way too long.  Irritating ""music"" you can't turn off (it keeps coming back).  Takes too long to unlock things.  Entire career mode is pointless when the game setup is so irritating I just wanted out.

This Bright and Early Book provides rhymed text and illustrations introducing the many meanings of the word ""up"" as Seuss and Blake show beginning readers that this is a ""Great day for up!""  You get the point half way through the book but little kids should be able to hand on longer, especially when they are reading the book for themselves.  Besides, by the end of ""Great Day for Up"" we get to the point where ""EVERYONE on Earth is up!"" (with one very important and rather ironic exception). As with all of the Bright and Early Books for Beginning Beginners what you have here is a brief and funny story, where the words are few and easy, there is a catchy rhythm, and the pictures are happy and colorful clues to the text.  These are designed for an even lower age group than the Bright and Early Books that followed ""The Cat in the Hat,"" which was the ""Harry Potter"" of its day when it came to encouraging even pre-schoolers to discover the delights of reading for themselves.

113,"Children are normally confused by the multiplicity of meanings that a simple word can have when they start reading.  Dr. Seuss has written a book here to can allow you to help your child understand that problem by looking at what ""up"" can mean in different contexts.  The beautiful watercolor and inked outline illustrations by Quentin Blake provide great context for these meanings. ""Up! Up!  The sun is getting up. The sun gets up so UP with you!"" Thus, this book begins.  You can see that Dr. Seuss has already connected the idea of the sun rising above the horizon in the east with your rising from your bed.  The book goes on to explore all the things that can rise.  These includes ears on a rabbit, hands, whiskers, and eyes. Once he goes into eyes, he then points out that many living creatures have eyes (including worms, frogs, butterflies, whales, and insects). Then, Dr. Seuss returns to ""up"" and gives new meanings.  These include taking something from a lower position to a higher one (like putting your feet up by walking on your hands), throwing things into the air (like balls), guiding things into the air (like kites), climbing (like going up a mountain -- Mt. Dill-ma-dilts in this case), and building mechanisms that can go up (like an elevator or a ferris wheel). Then, he returns ingeniously to the original concept of arising from bed: ""Wake ever person, pig and pup, till EVERYONE on Earth is up!"" Then comes the surprise ending that will keep you and your child chuckling for years. At first, you may just think the ending is there simply for humor, but it actually extends your child's understanding of what saying ""up"" means in terms of cause and effect. The book has all of the qualities I look for in an early reader.  The language is simple.  There is a limited vocabulary of short words.  The illustrations tie in clearly to the words.  The story is interesting, humorous, and upbeat.  A child can learn to recognize the key word, up, in just a few readings. After your child has mastered this wonderful story, I suggest that you encourage your child to use this book to identify synonyms for ""up"" which will extend the value of the book.  For example, you can use ""arise"" or ""rise"" in many of the contexts.  Then you can discuss how a speaker or a writer chooses which word version of a concept to use. May all of your child's learning experiences be UP to the ones available in this book!",1,"Children are normally confused by the multiplicity of meanings that a simple word can have when they start reading.  Dr. Seuss has written a book here to can allow you to help your child understand that problem by looking at what ""up"" can mean in different contexts.  The beautiful watercolor and inked outline illustrations by Quentin Blake provide great context for these meanings. ""Up! Up!  The sun is getting up. The sun gets up so UP with you!"" Thus, this book begins.  You can see that Dr. Seuss has already connected the idea of the sun rising above the horizon in the east with your rising from your bed.  The book goes on to explore all the things that can rise.  These includes ears on a rabbit, hands, whiskers, and eyes. Once he goes into eyes, he then points out that many living creatures have eyes (including worms, frogs, butterflies, whales, and insects). Then, Dr. Seuss returns to ""up"" and gives new meanings.  These include taking something from a lower position to a higher one (like putting your feet up by walking on your hands), throwing things into the air (like balls), guiding things into the air (like kites), climbing (like going up a mountain -- Mt. Dill-ma-dilts in this case), and building mechanisms that can go up (like an elevator or a ferris wheel). Then, he returns ingeniously to the original concept of arising from bed: ""Wake ever person, pig and pup, till EVERYONE on Earth is up!"" Then comes the surprise ending that will keep you and your child chuckling for years. At first, you may just think the ending is there simply for humor, but it actually extends your child's understanding of what saying ""up"" means in terms of cause and effect. The book has all of the qualities I look for in an early reader.  The language is simple.  There is a limited vocabulary of short words.  The illustrations tie in clearly to the words.  The story is interesting, humorous, and upbeat.  A child can learn to recognize the key word, up, in just a few readings. After your child has mastered this wonderful story, I suggest that you encourage your child to use this book to identify synonyms for ""up"" which will extend the value of the book.  For example, you can use ""arise"" or ""rise"" in many of the contexts.  Then you can discuss how a speaker or a writer chooses which word version of a concept to use. May all of your child's learning experiences be UP to the ones available in this book!"
114,"Installing the game was a struggle (because of games for windows live bugs). Some championship races and cars can only be ""unlocked"" by buying them as an addon to the game. I paid nearly 30 dollars when the game was new. I don't like the idea that I have to keep paying to keep playing. I noticed no improvement in the physics or graphics compared to Dirt 2. I tossed it in the garbage and vowed never to buy another codemasters game. I'm really tired of arcade style rally/racing games anyway.

122,"I have been playing car racing games since their early beginning on PC. I currently have a logitech G25 force feedback wheel to play with. I have played most of the Colin Mc Rae, Need for speed, Grid and Dirt2 games before. I also tried my hands at more simulation oriented games like GTR, GTR2, GP Legends... Dirt2 came in as a nice and pleasant surprise. Dirt3 tops it off. As I am sure many will detail everything about this game, I will limit myself to the most important points for me. Pros: - Amazing graphics - Amazing physics - Challenging but entertaining races Cons: - Gymkhana - Interface What went through the conceptors mind about gymkhana? Racing is not easy for most but gymkhana is really a pain in the neck. I saw the videos of Ken Block on Youtube and indeed he is really impressive. Am I even dreaming of doing the same? No! Racing require good racing skills to start but Gymkhana requires a perfect control of the vehicles and most of us will never achieve such level. So I find the attemps slightly pointless and extremely frustrating. Now, what about the interface? Simply put, it does not remotely compare with Dirt2's interface. It is messy, I had to search online to figure out where to find my best times. There are not enough info about the cars, the races, the sponsors... It leaves a lot to desire. A complete miss. Conclusion: As far as rallye racing. This game is the best out there today. If you are one who needs crazy challenges, try the gymkhana and good luck! In spite of my criticism, I definitely do not regreat this purchase.",0,"I have been playing car racing games since their early beginning on PC.

127,"I got this version instead of the PS3 version, which turned out to be a mistake. Console versions of games look 95 percent as good as their PC versions, but you do not have to deal with driver issues and the numerous things that can go wrong with windows. First off the installation takes about 30 minutes, which is ridiculous. I have never had a game take this long to load, Shift 2 took about 20 minutes which seemed too long also. Next many of the latest games for PC are forcing you to have an internet connection in order to install the game, regardless of whether you want to play only offline single player games. Shift 2 unleashed is also like this, so be forewarned. Internet requirements are not prominently displayed on the boxes. The game pushes you, but does not require you to, sign up for a Games For Windows Live account, which is required to get the game patches and updates. More time wasted signing up for that. Finally after about one hour the game was up and running , but the menu screen text had red blocky borders, and the sun in the game screens was ugly pink red, with red reflections on the car and everywhere. So more time spent googling to find a solution to this. I had to download a hot-fix driver update for my AMD videocard driver, which solved that red text and sun problem. Finally after nearly 2 hours I was able to play the game, which is perhaps the prettiest racing game I have ever played. Magnificent graphics, and fun excellent gameplay. Good forcefeedback effects with a steering wheel, and excellent sense of speed and immersion, makes this a top notch sim racer with just a hint of arcade feeling to it. I was really, finally enjoying the game , when suddenly about 30 minutes in to a race the game suddenly crashed. No error message or anything, it just hung up and crashed to desktop, under windows 7. I later tried it with Windows XP on the same machine, and it crashed less frequently, usually only when exiting the game, but random crashes really kill the fun of a racing game, since it might not crash during an entire 20 lap race or it might crash on the 2nd lap. It is a great game when it works, and if you are lucky enough to have a machine that it runs stably on then by all means get this game. But hang on to your receipt just in case. I am tired of fiddling with my computer trying to find a totally reliable setup for this game, so I think I am going to buy a copy for my PS3, which has never crashed, in over 3 years of game playing. I have been buying the top notch PC versions of videogames and spent thousands of dollars over the years on faster videocards and cpu's , but I have finally grown tired of fiddling with incompatibilities of hardware and software, and now game publishers demanding that you have an internet connection as well as providing a long serial number, utilizing gigabytes of harddrive space, 30 minute or longer installation times ( it takes less time to install Windows 7 ) , and requiring you to sign up for their online service and game store, and still you have to put that stupid little DVD in your computer everytime you want to play a simple game to relax. I am pretty much done with PC gaming, since the consoles are so much less hassle, and they have "" good enough "" graphics that the diminishing returns of costly higher resolution better antialiased higher framerate graphics is not worth it.

The volume is a rare welcome exception (there are a few Suessisms) and is an excellent book for first readers. The story is plain, with the major intention of teaching your child to *read* his or her first words in English (in this case the word is ""up""). But Quentin Blake's illustrations are superb and worth the price of the volume alone. The conclusion is a bit silly, and has a rather lazy aspect to it that parents need to guide their children on (no, it isn't okay to sleep in bed all day like the boy in the story, this is just a silly book""), but mostly this is unobjectionable.",0,"Dr. Suess's scansion and made-up words annoy me.

198,"This is one of those books that purports to be about something, and at some levels is actually about something pretty much unrelated. The next most important industry after oil in the Middle East is carpets. The author, Kremmer, is a journalist who spent a decade travelling around the region, reporting on various events for Australian new agencies of one sort or another. This is his story of his love affair with carpets, which turns into a pretty serious study of their styles, manufacture, sale and trade, and of the significance of these items in Muslim culture. While the oil is irrelevant to Muslims, except in terms of the money it generates, carpets can tell a lot about the heritage of the Muslim world. For the most part, this is interesting, and there's a lot to learn about Muslims and carpets. Only towards the end of the book does the author begin to veer into actual politics, and then, of course, he turns out to think that American policy in the Middle East is too agressive (this was late in the Clinton years...one shudders to think what his opinions are now). Thankfully, he at least hates Saddam Hussein and the mullahs who run Iran (journalists typically don't like governments that restrict freedom of the press, regardless of whatever else they do). This one proviso aside, there's a lot of intersting material here, and the book is well-written, the characters drawn interestingly, and the settings well-rendered. I would recommend this book.",1,"This is one of those books that purports to be about something, and at some levels is actually about something pretty much unrelated.

201,"Hand-woven carpets are one of the few products that Central Asia has consistently exported to the rest of the world, and by which the rest of the world knows of central Asia.  As such, a traversal of the routes and bazaars that comprise the carpet trade would take one through many of the important places in Central Asia.  Likewise, dealing with those involved in the trade would give insight into the history, economics and culture of those living in this area.  This then is the subject of this book. The author travels the bazaars and trade routes of Iraq, Iran, Pakistan, Afghanistan, and Kashmir looking for carpets.  While doing so, his interactions with the locals open up a whole world of history, culture, religion, food, and habits that are alien to those in the west.  Whether it is how to barter over goods, or the proper way to greet an older woman, the stories told by Mr. Kremmer bring to life places that many of us will never visit, yet that comprises a large part of this world both spatially and historically. The author intersperses his accounts with character studies of the various individuals he meets, side stories to fill in local histories, and editorials that connect what he seens in these far-off places to what occurs in Washington D.C. and the stockmarkets of the West.  Overall, a great travel book, a great history book, and a great story that is told.  I highly recommend this book.",1,"Hand-woven carpets are one of the few products that Central Asia has consistently exported to the rest of the world, and by which the rest of the world knows of central Asia.

203,"The Carpet Wars is a sampler of informal writing from Australian journalist (and avid carpet collector) Christopher Kremmer over ten years in Central Asia.  Since most of it was written, and concerns events, before 9/11, when the area was not established in the West's cultural radar as it is today, it gives a view of the region that is uncluttered by hindsight reevaluations. Kremmer writes of his time in Afghanistan, Pakistan, Tajikstan, Kashmir, and Iran, giving us colorful and non-journalistic slices of life from each region.  He enlivens his writings with vivid character studies of those he met on his travels, from dignitaries like ill-fated Afghan dictator Mohammed Najibullah and legendary guerilla Ahmad Shah Massoud to various carpet dealers Kremmer got to know over his time in the region.  Between these character sketches and Kremmer's anecdotes, he delivers measured doses of regional history and politics, and he imparts a surprising amount of information about his favorite hobby, the Asian carpet. The result is more than just some very entertaining travel writing.  Kremmer's lively and discursive work also functions as an excellent introduction to the Central Asian economy and politics.  Besides being for those who just like to read about travel in interesting foreign parts, The Carpet Wars will also be useful for non-scholars who want to have some idea how movements like the Taliban came to be, but want to take a spoonful of sugar with this medicine. (Kremmer's book also taught me that I'll never know enough to bargain effectively for an Asian carpet -- but his rueful and wry work also admits that there is a certain pleasure in being cheated.)",1,"The Carpet Wars is a sampler of informal writing from Australian journalist (and avid carpet collector) Christopher Kremmer over ten years in Central Asia.

206,"I finished this book about six weeks ago, and I can't stop thinking about it. So often travel literature-type books by westerners in these kinds of far-off places can be either too clever, cynical or condescending at one end of the scale, or, at the other end too reverent, with a reverence that seems to really be an I-hate-where-I-am-from complex. Both extremes can get tiring pretty quickly. The Carpet Wars was exactly in the middle, and it was fascinating. It was extremely informative about the history, politics, religion and, yes, even the carpets of the region from Pakistan to Iran.  Carpets were merely the thread (so to speak) that held the several first-hand accounts of travels to the region. Kremmer is a master story teller, and very funny.  Sometimes it was hard to tell what was more enjoyable, the story he was telling or the way he was telling it. His accounts of places with which he is very familiar are told in the rich tones of a deep affection.  When he is in a new place, like Isfahan, the account is in the vivid colors of someone seeing something for the first time, creating some of the best travel essays I have ever read. Seven weeks ago, Isfahan was just an exotic name to me, now it's at the top of places I hope I can see before I die. Its hard to say what recommends this book more, the fact that it is throughly enjoyable, or deeply infomrative. I haven't read Mr. Kremmer's book about Laos, but it is probably pretty good.

209,"Anyone interested in the fine art of rug weaving, the cultures in which Oriental carpets originate, the geography of ancient trade routes including The Silk Road, the history, economics and politics of the Middle East, and present day travel through the strife-torn region will find immense treasure in Christopher Kremmer's The Carpet Wars.  ""The early Muslims inhabited lands where people were born on carpets, prayed on them, and covered their tombs with them.  For centuries, carpets have been a currency and an export, among the first commodities of a globalized trading system"" writes the author, who has spent ten years in Asia reporting for the Australian press.  He uses Oriental rugs as his motif for writing about his travels in Afghanistan, Pakistan, Iraq, Iran, Tajikistan, Kashmir, and the former Soviet satellite countries of Central Asia.  {Here, this reviewer admits his interest enfolds some bias because of my own travels through the region as a Peace Corps worker in less turbulent times.  Also, I have the good fortune of working in a store where a wide variety of the very finest examples of Oriental carpets are sold.}  In this book we read that second only to oil, hand made carpets are the region's principal export and were so long before Marco Polo made his famous travels along the Silk Road.  Carpets created by various quarreling factions from the Middle and Near East are the focus for retelling how the fighting clans have damaged the carpet trade, effectively wiping out the middle and upper class of society, and left appalling poverty and misery in its wake.  Kremmer describes how that even in the midst of war and turmoil, a bazaar will spring up during breaks in the fighting and the carpet merchants will quickly resume business as if nothing had happened.  A disappointment for me was that the author omits a description of the many varieties and techniques of rug making; he remains focused on his travels through the Islamic world, giving us the benefit of his first hand witness to the misery.  Believing that only Allah can create anything perfect, the Muslim carpet makers often will deliberately craft a minor flaw in their handiwork that only a practiced eye might discern.  Also, we learn that many rugs woven by people living under the duress of conflict will reflect their anxieties and turmoil through the symbols of war - airplanes, helicopters, tanks, and guns.  But the rugs also will contain symbols of their makers' traumatic lives not altogether discernible or understood.  Like the great paintings of the Renaissance, these works of art may never be fully comprehended.  It is enough that fortunate owners of hand knotted and woven rugs might appreciate not only their beauty but also how they portray the soulful deeper meaning of the lives of their creators, leaving a legacy for generations to come.  This book is an armchair journey of immense interest.  Highly recommended.

213,"Christopher Kremmer's book takes you on a journey through the Central Asian countries most frequently in the news today, and provides an incomparable insight. The largest, and first, section, is an account of events in Afghanistan, which he has witnessed first-hand as a foreign correspondent. This book is no dry history, nor is it merely a travelogue, nor is it merely an extended piece of journalism. Kremmer comes to know and befriend people of different backgrounds within the region, and it is their stories, as well as the carpet trade and stories of emblematic carpets, through which the narrative is woven. We care about the future of the peoples of the region, because we care about what becomes of Kremmer's friends. What Christopher has managed to do is to make the internecine politics, the inhumanities, the brutalities, comprehensible, through his humanisation of peoples who might in lesser hands be reduced to the merely 'exotic' or even worse 'unknowable and inhuman'. Earlier this year I read 'Unexpected Light: Travels in Afghanistan' by Jason Elliot.

Earlier this year I read 'Unexpected Light: Travels in Afghanistan' by Jason Elliot. I thoroughly recommend both these books if you desire to reach some understanding of a region of such importance to us all."

I had read only a couple of the Jim Chee/Leaphorn books when I visited Gallup, New Mexico in 92 and 93 but I almost expected to see one of the books' characters appear at the Giant Truck Stop coffee shop or one of the tiny diners we saw on Hwy 36.

220,"""The Sinister Pig"" (a term which has a couple of meanings in the book) is another fine addition to Tony Hillerman's Joe Leaphorn/Jim Chee series.  This one involves a somewhat more complex plot than most of the previous ones, and as for character development, Mr. Hillerman seems to take it for granted that the readers of this book have also read at least some of the others, and that therefore he does not need to go into too much detail as to the personalities of his characters.  Having said that, though, I enjoyed the book very much, and my only real complaint is, as with ""The Wailing Wind"", it is, at about 230 pages, just too short.  But it is always a rare treat to be reunited with our old friends from the Navajo Tribal Police, and as an added bonus this edition features a happy ending romantically for the ever-lovelorn Jim Chee.  Here's hoping Mr. Hillerman keeps the Leaphorn/Chee series coming, and that he adds a hundred or so pages to his next tale.",1,"""The Sinister Pig"" (a term which has a couple of meanings in the book) is another fine addition to Tony Hillerman's Joe Leaphorn/Jim Chee series.

225,"""The Sinister Pig"" is another in Hillerman's long-running series of mystery novels centering upon the now retired, but hardly inactive, Lieutenant Joe Leaphorn and Sergeant Jim Chee of the Navajo Tribal Police.  This time the plot is in part inspired by the continuing scandal over the mismanagement - embezzlement and outright theft may be closer to the point - of funds due to Southwest Indian tribes for oil, gas, and coal taken from their reservations under Federal auspices.  An investigator sent by a powerful Washington, DC, senator to nose around turns up dead with a bullet in his back.  It is Jim Chee's case - or at least as much of the case as the FBI will let him handle - but it is immediately clear that somebody with high connections back in Washington wants the investigation squelched. Meanwhile, Jim Chee has something else on his mind.  Bernadette Manuelito, formerly an officer in the Navajo Tribal Police, has taken a new job with the Border Patrol, 200 miles away, just when Chee was working up his resolve to make his personal interest clear to her.  And now Bernie has stumbled on some mysterious goings-on along the Mexican border that might tie in to the unsolved murder back home. Hillerman departs somewhat from his usual format by writing several chapters from outside the viewpoint of Leaphorn and Chee (and Bernie Manuelito).  Unlike in most Hillerman novels, we very quickly learn who the bad guys are, although a mystery remains until the final chapters as to exactly what they are doing.  In general Hillerman's villains are not especially villainous, their motivations often arising from quite ordinary circumstances that lead them into crimes they never intended.  But in ""The Sinister Pig"" the chief villain is as close to plain evil as Hillerman is ever likely to get. One disappointment: an element which usually sets Hillerman's mystery novels apart from all others is their exploration of the culture and religion of the Navajos and their Indian neighbors, this being integral to the book plot and often crucial to the solution of the mystery at hand.  In the present novel we see almost nothing of this, except for some peripheral matters that only touch upon Jim Chee himself.  Washington powerbrokers are a less engaging group than the people of the Big Rez. ""The Sinister Pig"" is not the best of Hillerman, to be sure, and it might be argued that it works primarily as simply being part of a continuing series about characters to whom we have come to feel close over the years.  But a Hillerman book that is not amongst his best work is still a good mystery.  And readers who count Joe Leaphorn and Jim Chee as literary friends will want to find what has now happened in their personal lives. Hillerman's Navajo novels have continuing background stories that develop from novel to novel over time.  Therefore, readers new to Hillerman would be well advised to begin not with this latest novel but back at the beginning of the series, getting to know the characters as their lives evolve.

243,"Not everything I read is an ARC ... I'm a pretty dedicated library user as well. I've long been a fan of the American Southwest.  It is one of my favorite places to visit and vacation.  I've also been aware that Tony Hillerman - a name that any bibliophile should recognize - writes mysteries set in the American Southwest.  So why haven't I read his works before this? Mostly I think it's because I've only recently developed an affection for the mystery/thriller genre. Although sixteenth in a series, I don't get the impression that reading the previous fifteen books in a necessity to enjoy this.  The reader is likely to understand some of the character relationships that have developed over the course of the series, but the story itself seems to be contained within the covers. Bernadette ""Bernie"" Manuelito once worked for the Tribal Police but now is a Border Patrol/Customs Officer.  She quickly develops a reputation for herself and while helping out some stranded border-crossers, she is told that a photo of her has been circulating around Mexico, identifying her as potentially dangerous and someone the criminals might want to be rid of. She becomes a target when she visits an exotic game ranch which was once a station for a gas pipeline.  Unknown to Bernie, but figuring it out when he learns she's become a target, is Sergeant Jim Chee, who is madly in love with Bernie.  The old pipe lines might be in use to smuggle something in to the country. But knowing what is being smuggled and who is the force (and money) behind the operation, is something that brings even more danger to Bernie, Chee, and Joe Leaphorn. I found this to be pretty standard (and average) mystery/thriller fare. The bad guys were appropriately bad, but they also seemed sort of 'Bond' bad - stereotyped bad guys.  Wealthy, white, powerful, connected. I found the set-up really interesting and the regular characters pretty believable and worth following for a couple more books at least, but I was disappointed in the 'resolution' of the story.  I'm not real fond of the deus ex machina  ending or the dumb luck/getting out of a jam because of something or someone completely outside of the protagonists control. As I say, this was pretty average.  It often felt very dated, not just but how characters were acting, but how they were being portrayed.  I'll read a few more and see how I feel about the series.

249,"The plot and action are fine. Tony Hillerman certainly can tell a story, and although this one is only on Navajo land for a short time as the scene for the murder which opens the book, Hillerman does an excellent job of re-setting the scene in southernmost New Mexico as Officer Bernie Manueliti leaves the Tribal Police for a new job with the US Border Patrol. Cowboy Dashie and Joe Leaphorn play their usual solid key roles, a rogue pilot/political henchman adds a great deal to the plot, an evil villain gets what he deserves, but the steady and taciturn Jim Chee is instead portrayed as a bumbling idiot, especially when facing his feelings for Manuelito. All the parts of the plot make sense and intersect nicely, the title fits nicely, but unfortunately there is very little authentic Navajo lore to add to the atmosphere. That is usually a highlight in a Hillerman novel, and I missed that. I still would have given the book 4 stars, if it weren't for the really weak ""romance"" between Chee and Manuelito. It never felt real or genuine, and its lame, sobbing 1950s-style resolution should make every female reader shake her head in despair. All mystery lovers and Tony Hillerman fans expect better from such a skilled author.",0,"The plot and action are fine. Tony Hillerman certainly can tell a story, and although this one is only on Navajo land for a short time as the scene for the murder which opens the book, Hillerman does an excellent job of re-setting the scene in southernmost New Mexico as Officer Bernie Manueliti leaves the Tribal Police for a new job with the US Border Patrol. Cowboy Dashie and Joe Leaphorn play their usual solid key roles, a rogue pilot/political henchman adds a great deal to the plot, an evil villain gets what he deserves, but the steady and taciturn Jim Chee is instead portrayed as a bumbling idiot, especially when facing his feelings for Manuelito. All the parts of the plot make sense and intersect nicely, the title fits nicely, but unfortunately there is very little authentic Navajo lore to add to the atmosphere. That is usually a highlight in a Hillerman novel, and I missed that. I still would have given the book 4 stars, if it weren't for the really weak ""romance"" between Chee and Manuelito. It never felt real or genuine, and its lame, sobbing 1950s-style resolution should make every female reader shake her head in despair. All mystery lovers and Tony Hillerman fans expect better from such a skilled author."

253,"In recent memory, strategy guides have become less of a necessity and more of a collector's item.  For every game nowadays there is a guide to accompany it.  Sometimes there's a collector's edition guide as well.  For collector's these are sometimes a lot of fun.  For Zelda fans that enjoy Zelda lore this collection is a fantastic buy.  There is a limited number in print and it's simply amazing to behold.  It's great packaging and actually has things in there specifically for collectors. Before I begin I want to stress that this review won't be going into the content of each guide.  With the exception of the Skyward Sword guide, each of these guides is exactly the same as their standard (and separately released) collector's edition counterpart.  The reason Skyward Sword is not the same is because this copy was revised and expanded upon.  Aside from that, the other five guides are largely unchanged from their original releases.  There are subtle differences but nothing that greatly changes the actual content in the guide. To begin, the guides come packaged in a box that looks like a chest.  When you open it up there are six hardbound guides in there.  The covers all look very similar.  Each one having an embossed Hyrule symbol on them.  The covers and the borders are different on each guide.  The six guides included are for Twilight Princess, Phantom Hourglass, Spirit Tracks, Ocarina of Time 3D, Skyward Sword and the Windwaker HD.  All the guides have gold leaf pages that are shiny when looking at them from the side. There are a couple of things to note about the guides themselves.  The first is that it seems just a little strange that the guides themselves are not actually individually shrink wrapped.  This seems a little odd.  It's not that big of a deal but when you open the packaging they're already loose.  Considering each original release came shrink wrapped it's a little strange.  Perhaps the thing that some consumers might mind is that none of these guides come with their respective extras.  Anything that was considered a bonus for getting the collector's edition guide isn't here.  Likewise, when this particular collection was announced, The Legend of Zelda: A Link Between Worlds simply wasn't planned for the package.  So anyone hoping this guide comes with the collection are out of luck.  That's no big deal. There are also a couple of things to note here about only a couple of guides.  The first and most obvious is the Ocarina of Time 3D guide.  Prima NEVER actually released a hardcover edition of this guide.  Ever.  This is the first time that Ocarina of Time 3D players will get to grab this guide in hardcover.  Originally the guide was only in paperback.  This makes the collector's value certainly worthwhile as it means that the guide will have much more limited hardcover run than all the other guides here.  This boxset is more or less your only chance to get it. The second thing of note is that the Skyward Sword guide included here is NOT the same as the one originally published.  It has been revised and expanded.  Even the layout is very different from the original guide itself.  It has been revised and expanded by over 100 pages.  It is almost a completely new guide from the original one that was released.  So yes, this one too is a rarity because you won't have much luck finding it outside of this particular box set. There are a couple of subtle differences between some guides and the originals.  Most notably is the Ocarina of Time 3D guide.  The original guide was around 224 pages and written in three columns.  Here it's 288 pages and is written in two columns.  It's a lot easier to read and a lot cleaner as a result.  Much of the text isn't so cramped.  Some moments in the Ocarina of Time 3D guide pop out a lot easier.  It just looks better and more organized overall.  The Legendary Checklist in the Ocarina of Time Guide is also better looking.  The tables are easier to read and easier on the eyes.  Likewise, the Legendary Checklist in the Twilight Princess Guide is A LOT easier to read and A LOT less cramped.  In the original guide the entire checklist was on a single page with just the location.  Here it's expanded to be in a table format, the font is bigger and it now lets you know your first chance to complete it as well as telling you what's required.  The Phantom Hourglass and Spirit Tracks guides are virtually unchanged from their initial releases.  The Windwaker HD is pretty much the same as well.  So for those wondering about whether or not they've changed some things from the original guides, the answer is yes.  Quite simply put some of them are a tad easier to read. The set also came with a few bonuses of note.  The first and probably most valuable of all, is that you get a certificate of authentication from Eijo Aonuma that is signed and numbered.  The second is a laser etched metallic bookmark.  For collectors this package is a pretty sweet deal.  It's invaluable.  The only thing I wish we could've gotten would have been to actually get all the extras the guides themselves actually came with.  It is more or less the only thing I feel is missing and keeping it from being a complete package.  Part of what made the guides collector's editions aside from the hardcovers was actually getting little bonuses that didn't come with the guide otherwise. Nevertheless, for the fan of Zelda this is a good buy.  But let's be clear.  If you are buying this, chances are it is probably not to actually utilize the guides themselves.  After all, many of the games these guides are for have been out for a while and, truthfully, you could just buy them on their own if you really wanted them for strategy.

256,"I have been looking forward to receiving this set since I learned about and pre-ordered it back in August. I am a huge Zelda fan and always wanted to get my hands on the strategy guides, but never seemed to get around to buying them when they first released and, over time, they became very expensive. This works out great because we can get all of the Collector's Edition guides, plus one never released and only available in this set (Ocarina of Time) for a great price - each guide ends up being less than $20 each not including the packaging. As other have said, the packaging is wonderful. The treasure chest box is better quality than I had anticipated and the gold, metal etched bookmark is gorgeous! The actual shipping packaging was great, as well - very well protected with lots of foam so it arrived in pristine shape. The guides themselves are gorgeous! Great detail and amazing artwork. I also love how the paper edges are golden - it gives it a very classy look. I have yet to actually read through them, let alone use them, so I can't say how accurate and useful they are, but I am sure the do their job and then some. I was very concerned about the Skyward Sword guide because the reviews for the original version were absolutely terrible. Fortunately, however, I read that it has been updated to meet the quality of all of the other guides, so that was a huge sigh of relief. I do have a few gripes for this set, though. They are quite minor in the grand scheme of things, so it didn't kill it for me too much - they are just things I wish they would have included. First, I am very disappointed that no guides were made for the older Zelda games, i.e. Zelda I and II for NES, Link to the Past for SNES, LInk's Awakening for Gameboy, etc. I wouldn't even mind if they threw several games into one or two books to make it more efficient - it would just have been nice to have guides for every Zelda game in one set. Second, I was disappointed they didn't leave an empty slot for A Link Between Worlds. They've had this planned for a while and have had to have known the game was coming out the same time as this, as well as the collector's edition guide. Not a huge deal, but again... would have been a nice consideration. Third (and this is just something I would have thought to be cool - not dinging this set at all for not doing it) it would have been INCREDIBLE if they had some sort of audio device inside that makes the chest opening music from say Ocarina of Time when you open it - similar to when you open a greeting card with pre-recorded messages. Perhaps someday I will figure out how to do it myself - until then I will have to just sing the tune myself :) Finally, I am sad that some of the bonus content that came with the guides when they were originally released weren't included. I will be honest, I don't know which guides came with what, but I have seen others complain about this, stating that Twilight Princess in particular came with a few goodies. Overall, I am very happy with this set. For Zelda fans, it is a must buy especially if you don't own many or any of these guides already.

332,"I happened to find this book light by accident, and what a happy accident it was! I bought the Harry Potter version (because it was on sale for only $25 vs. the plain one being regular price at $35) and the only difference is that it comes with different buttons for the on/off switch that you can swap out depending on your mood. Otherwise it's exactly like the plain version - same size (sized to read hardcover books). I also bought the soft case to store it in while not in use. (Very glad I got that!) Pros: I no longer bother my husband when I read in bed. It puts light directly where I need it and I DON'T have to keep adjusting it. It does NOT get hot. It doubles as a bookmark. The batteries last a LONG time! The optional case protects it from scratches and keeps it clean when you are not using it as a bookmark. Cons: It gets dirty (smudged) quickly, even if your hands are clean (and you MUST be careful to use a good cleaner or it will get scratched - I use the spray I clean my eyeglasses with along with a special cloth and it works just fine). The light may flicker a bit at times (I think because I must joggle the switch while moving it from one side of the book to the other) - just wiggle the ""on"" switch and it stops. If you are reading a hardcover book it is the perfect size. If you switch to reading paperback books, it's over-sized and you must compensate by moving it around until you find an angle that is comfortable for you to hold both the light and the book. Otherwise you could buy the paperback size version of this light. (Things could be worse - I guess it's better to buy large and compensate for small vs. buying small and having to constantly move the light around for larger books - just FYI.) ******** I bought this LightWedge from Amazon and am very happy with it. I then found the company's website (bigger and brighter dot com) and they have all the different versions (size, color, etc.) of LightWedge, all the accessories for the LightWedge, plus other things I had no idea existed to read a book with.

It is about the dimensions of a full sized book and the black handle which houses the battery/light source is somewhat bulky.  A small button toggles the light intensity from low to dim to off. USE Place the item on the page that you want to read, push the button to the light intensity that you desire (allow your eyes to adjust to the darkness, which may take a minute or more), and flip the item to the other page to read.  As you turn the page, you will need to take the item out, and place it back into the book. In concept, this product is ideal.  You have a light source that is limited to the pages that you are viewing.  However, even on the highest intensity (let's call it dim and dimmer), the light is still somewhat low.  What can you read with this item?  Books that have high contrast paper (glossy pages are most ideal since the reflective proper of the paper allows for better view).  Conventional novels are a bit more difficult to read.  Magazines are impossible unless you read on your stomach with the magazine placed on the bed.  Furthermore, pictures are difficult to see, at best. DURABILITY Like any screen on a laptop, I placed a SCREEN PROTECTOR on my lightwedge to prevent scratches.  Any scratch with transmit uneven light (more than usual). Given that LEDs have very little power requirements, I have had the same batteries in the unit for the past 3 years, and it is still running. DESIGN RECOMMENDATIONS More LED bulbs along the 'spine' of the handle would improve the light intensity. A thinner, scratch resistant plastic with a lighter handle would be a marked improvement.

I thought I had been very careful in loading the batteries, but what do you know, one of them was facing the wrong way. Once that was fixed, the thing lit up much brighter.

Good, innocence, and redemption, after much suspense emerge victorious, of course, and my only disappointment is that the author did not give the villain a more fitting end.

411,"My 5 year old son decided to murder my gamepad, and this is EXACTLY what i needed to repair it. The damage appeared to be from a red ink pen which he furiously scrubbed into the screen after he removed my screen protector(not a good day for anyone). The touch screen and its hard cover were both damaged. Before you buy this part, look up some youtube videos on how to replace it, and decide if you're comfortable doing this.. It took me about an hour or two, to cautiously tear apart, and replace it. You will also need a special tri wing screwdriver to open the casing. It's nothing overly complicated, but you will be tearing your gamepad down to its bare bones since the screen in on the ""bottom"" of the device. The screen i received had black trim on the front, which matched my black gamepad. Your mileage may vary on the color since it didn't specify in the item listing. In the end, I replaced the screen and saved myself the pain of buying a new/used/refurb gamepad for $150-$180. If done properly, no one will ever know you opened the gamepad.

425,"While most of Hillermans Joe Leaphorn novels rest on a strong sense of place, this one could take place almost anywhere. It also shifts the focus from the retired Leaphorn to Jim Chee and especially Bernie Manuelito.  I found some of their decisions puzzling, to say the least. The plot here is also weaker than others. The story rests on a device that I have seen elsewhere, in both film and novels, including a variant in one of the older James Bond movies. Its not that mysterious, and unfortunately I did not find the denouement at all credible. Still, Hillerman knows how to move a story along.

441,"It works fine for PS/PS2 controllers, though rumble isn't supported. In analog mode, the D-pad is mapped to buttons 13-16 instead of a hat switch as you might expect. This can mean extra configuration for some games, but it does allow it to register simultaneous presses of opposite directions (eg. left+right), which has always been one of the odd things about PlayStation controllers. In digital mode, the left stick reads as centered but the Z and Z Rotation axes (right stick) are either all the way up or down, which can cause some trouble. The N64 side doesn't work at all for me. I tried it with both an OEM Nintendo controller and an InterAct MakoPad 64 (both tested and work perfectly with a real N64). With both of them, all buttons and axes (even the ones N64 controllers don't have, like the right stick) constantly press and unpress on their own. Note that there is a switch on the left side of the unit that switches between N64 and PlayStation modes. Away from you is PlayStation (left/red LED), towards you is N64 (right/green LED).

454,"Officer Bernadette Manuelito is a good investigator  intrepid, clever and resourceful. But it's these very qualities that seem to get her in difficulties. Now she's no longer a cop working for Sergeant Chee at Shiprock. Partly to forget Chee, who's failing to get romantic, she takes a job on the Mexican border. There she encounters some shady characters and dicey situations on a mysterious ranch stocked with exotic game animals. Chee meanwhile is occupied with a mysteriously well-dressed unidentified dead body. Leaphorn too gets involved in this case.  But neither is too busy to worry about Bernie and get involved in her complications. Bernie gets a quick education on border patrolling, and so do we. There is a wonderfully despicable villain in the plot, and an unexpected hero. Chee's best friend Cowboy Dashee also plays a role. He's an Apache and prone to poke fun at Navajos, the heredity enemy of his tribe. His quips are always amusing. The Leaphorn and Chee mysteries are consistently delightful, with clever plots, tense action, engaging characters, terrific atmosphere, and always a fascinating picture of Native American culture in New Mexico. But I will add that my husband, a fellow Hillerman fan, found this book a bit weak with the contrivance of too many coincidences.

462,"My father is a seaman. I have seen many ships, sailed with him around the world numerous times. So ships are in my blood. When i saw this game I bought it without batting an eyelid. Well I wish I didn't because I now regret my decision. The game is unique in its concept. We never really had a maritime ship simulation that wasn't centrally focused on war and sinking other ships :). This one happens to be just peace-time shipping simulation with different kinds of detailed ships ranging from cargo, to passenger, to rescues, to towing, to even trying to alter history by succesfully sailing Titanic to New york on its first maiden voyage etc. The game creator has gone to great details to simulate as much as possible the Intricacies of piloting as well as managing huge ships operations. Any aspiring sea captian or sea salt will identify with some if not most aspects of piloting a ship as simulated in this game. But to me thats where all the goodies end. The cons associated with game are just too game-breaking to me and i have essentially stopped playing the game. Until these issues gets addressed i am not spending anymore money on this games series. First and foremost this game badly needs a voluntary ""Time Compression"" feature. Not all of us have 2-3 hours to devote each time we decide to play this game to have some fun. Sometimes it take an hour or so just to get out of harbour and tag some hours more on this to complete the mission. With a game in which you are looking at ocean waves for hours this gets boring really fast. This is just plain very annoying and game destroying factor to me. I know some people have all the time in the world to savour and enjoy games but a lot don't too. Since its not a action oriented game the passage of time is felt even more. If they can incorporate a Time Compression feature it will make the game lot more open to different segments of gamers. Second is the still dated graphics engine. I see lots of people commenting on how good the graphics look. I have a pretty good rig and i can play games like Mass Effect and Silent Hunter 4 in almost thearatical quality but even with everything maxed out this game just looks medicore graphics wise. The ships and ocean etc. looks very simplistically rendered from today's standard. The graphical quality of this game released in 2008 is kind of dissappointing though. Last some of the missions in the game are just plain novice or fillers in my opinion. This game is geared towards people who like to pilot huge ships yet we have a lot of missions devoted to speed boats for stunts, hover boats etc. I bought the game to simulate a ship expirience not go around flipping in speed boats. Anyways..i wouldn't really recommend anyone spend $40 bucks on this game. Wait until it gets to $19 or so bargain bin.

509,"If you're thinking of buying The Sinister Pig to get your Joe Leaphorn and Jim Chee fix, you might want to look for another Hillerman novel.  This book centers on Chee's new love, Officer Bernadette Manuelito, once a member of the Navajo police force.  As the book opens, Bernie, as she's called, has transferred to the Border Patrol.  She's miserable because she misses Chee, but he had never told her how he felt about her, so she left . . .  Well, it's an old story. Meanwhile, Chee is agonizing about her being gone, but doesn't want to pick up the phone and call her or go to see her because she might tell him to get lost or . . .  Yeah, an old story. With this kind of start, a reader might think it's going to be the old saw about the man rescuing his lovely girlfriend, realizing how much he loves her, and they live happily ever after.  Well, not quite. Getting to the end of this tale, however, is far from a straight line as Hillerman concentrates on one plot point, then another, then another.  It would seem that he heard about how the ""pig"" is used to clean pipelines and decided it would make a good story.  It certainly is the centerpiece of this story.  Oh, that and a hit man who . . .  Mustn't give that away either. For all its seeming shortcomings, The Sinister Pig provides bits of Leaphorn and Chee for diehard Hillerman fans to enjoy and descriptions of New Mexico to ponder.

511,"The consensus on Amazon clearly seems to be that The Sinister Pig is one of Hillerman's lesser works. In some ways, I'd agree. It's certainly different, in important respects, from his other mysteries set in the Four Corners region. Primarily, it lacks the anthropological focus that's helped to make Hillerman's mysteries so unique and enjoyable over the years. The Native American cultures, which provide surprising depth to the characters as they negotiate their identities up against their traditions, and which also establish the cosmic setting in which the events of the novel are understood, are only hinted at in the novel. Not even the title is drawn from Native American mythology; it's a term borrowed from the oiling industry. So, there's no doubt that a large part of the formula that has produced Hillerman's success is lacking. That's worth knowing going into the book. But that said, I still enjoyed The Sinister Pig, just for different reasons than normal. The book is pretty well-plotted, as is usual for Hillerman. I've really thought that some of the the complaints against the plot I've read (i.e. having a good idea of the who masterminded the crime early on) were oversold, since those elements tend to appear in other Hillerman novels. The Sinister Pig's plot, though not as complex as always, is perfectly sensible and features a fine red herring. Mainly, though, I enjoyed the book because the rest of the series has taught me to admire and care for Hillerman's characters, especially for Jim Chee and Bernie Manuelito here, and The Sinister Pig features important progress for them. That's the main thing that's different about The Sinister Pig. Hillerman has always used anthropology and myth to augment and enrich the mysteries, and that's gotten him his audience. Here, however, he'a a little more traditional, using simple romance, instead, as the special extra ingredient. That switch will leave many Hillerman fans less satisfied with this volume, and The Sinister Pig is also not the place to begin reading Hillerman. But I certainly thought it was fine for a change. I enjoyed it as a solid and light little mystery that also brought about some pleasant developments for two of my favorite characters.",1,"The consensus on Amazon clearly seems to be that The Sinister Pig is one of Hillerman's lesser works.

514,"Tony Hillerman's THE SINISTER PIG reads like a half-hearted effort to fulfill a contract, not to tell a good story. Some great threads are inherent, but the unravel instead of weave. The reader is bounced from the border where Bernie Manuelito is now working to the Four Corners for a murder. The strongest theme is embezzlement of tribal funds, but here Hillerman waxes lightly. Okay, but not his best. Nash Black, author of SINS OF THE FATHERS.",0,"Tony Hillerman's THE SINISTER PIG reads like a half-hearted effort to fulfill a contract, not to tell a good story.

516,"THE SETUP An apparently retired CIA agent (Gordon Stein, aka David Slate) is hired by a U.S. Senator to investigate how a natural gas pipeline system has been used to cheat Native Americans in the Southwest of $4 billion annually in royalties.  He is murdered on Navajo land in the extreme northwestern corner of New Mexico.  Navajo Tribal Policeman (Sargent) Jim Chee is assigned to assist the FBI in the investigation.  In the meantime Bernadette Manualetto has resigned from the tribal police, because she is annoyed with Chee for not pursuing her, and has joined (implausibly) the Border Patrol, and thus is stationed in the extreme southwestern corner of New Mexico, along the Mexican border.  She observes some odd ""goings-on"" on the large private Tuttle Ranch on the border.  That's the setup. COMMENTS Earlier novels in the series were very ""economical"", with a few well developed characters, and straightforward filler-free stories.  With the previous novel, ""Wailing Wind"", and even more-so with the ""Sinister Pig"". Hillerman is (unfortunately?) entering the mainstream of police mystery novels, with dozens of named characters, most throw-away (i.e., that appear on one or two pages, never to be heard from or of again, with no particular significance to the novel); and complex plots.  The stories are no longer about Native Americans, but rather are about ""white people"" who coincidentally interact somehow with Jim Chee, et al.  The fascinating expositions on Native religion and philosophy is over, except for thin references.  Fortunately, Hillerman is sufficiently talented to keep up with mainstream mystery writers.  But I, for one, miss the earlier character-centric and Native-centric novels. CAVEATS The novel is unnecessarily confused by two premises:  1) The first is that pipelines were being used in the rip-off of Native American royalties.  That simply makes no sense---the routing of petroleum in pipelines is irrelevant, just as irrelevant as the highways a petroleum tanker truck drives on.  It is in the accounting that any rip-offs of Native American royalties could have taken place.  2) The second premise is a cocaine importation scheme.  It looks like these two storylines were intended to converge, but don't. Other evidence of rushed, poorly-edited writing, are redundancies, such as the multiply repeated explaination of the functioning of pipeline pigs. Readers are teased with the promise of a delicious expose of political corruption, then perhaps a scheme by Al Queda to smuggle nuclear weapons into the U.S., but are finally left with a few sleazy druggies.  Certainly, when you start turning over rocks, the slimy creatures you find are not necessarily the ones you were looking for, but, in the final analysis there was no adequate reason for the murder of Slate/Stein. Moreover, unless I misread the book, the illegal-alien family which Bernie rescued had immigrated on rumors that a copper smelter on the U.S. side of the border would be reopened.  (The fictional smelter closely corresponds to the Hildalgo Smelter, which was closed in 1999.  ironically the company town of Playas was purchased by the U.S. Government for an anti-terrorism training center).  Then the closed smelter is described as being located in Mexico, and is the origin from which ""pigs"" are transported to the Tuttle Ranch on the U.S. side of the border.  Huh?

521,"Among the various detective novelists writing today, Tony Hillerman occupies a pretty unique position. His series of detective novels, following first the adventures of two different characters, Lt. Joe Leaphorn and Sgt. Jim Chee, in separate books. Later, Hillerman combined the two characters, and has been chronicling their combined adventures for a good long time now. He's added supporting characters, including a series of girlfriends for Chee, a wife who died and then a lady friend for Leaphorn, and colleagues like the inimitable Cowboy Dashee, who's appeared in the background of several of the books. This latest entry in the series isn't the strongest, but it is interesting. Someone's been killed on the Reservation, and before anyone can investigate, the FBI shows up and closes down the investigation, announcing the improbably verdict of ""hunting accident"". Chee doesn't buy the explanation, and both he and Leaphorn take to investigating on their own. Meanwhile, a former colleague of theirs, Bernadette Manuelito, has gone to work for the Border Patrol. While there, she discovers things which seem to link into the investigation on the Reservation that Chee and Leaphorn are running. I enjoyed this book well enough.

Keeps it from getting dirty as fast especially if you have a white controller. Overall it feels good and is comfortable even in long play periods. The only problem I have is there is annoying little piece up by the triggers on both sides. Its right in between the trigger and the bumper buttons and there is no tension on the piece so when you switch between the bumper and triggers it can sometimes flip up and your finger will catch it. Not really a deal breaker or a big deal or anything since I plan on cutting it off anyways. Plan on buy another so far after this one falls apart. Will update my review if it doesnt last long.,0,Have had this skin for almost 2 months and so far there are no signs of wear or tear which is good.

549,"The ""sinister pig"" in this story is not just a machine used in pipelines.  That would be pretty meaningless to us.  Our sinister pig is the story's villain, sinister because he will kill anyone to further his goals, and a pig because, wealthy that he is, he never has enough. He is a very safe villain.  Everybody can hate him.  He's a politically correct villain.  Some rich pig who is greedy as can be, and murderous.  What's not to hate? This was my first Hillerman story, so I was not at all familiar with any of the characters.  There isn't one character in this story that I feel compelled to read more about.  I'm not rushing to find another Hillerman story. I didn't read the book.  I listened to the audio book while at work.  I'm always appreciative of someone reading a story to me while I'm stuck at work.  I can't sit behind my desk and read. The opening of the book is a shocker.  We are introduced to a nearly retired CIA agent.  He is, apparently, the star of the book.  But no, he's not.  Boom, he's gone. The rest of the story has to play out without the main character.  It is one of the oddest structured books I've ever come across.  The first character, the one who dominated the first chapter, is gone.  Bye.  See ya.  Now on to someone else. And there is no star after him.  There is a handful of co-stars.  I'm not used to that.  This is very unique in that regard.  Normally, a story has a star.  This one doesn't. One drawback with being read to is that we are dependent on the person reading, and we have to listen to him do all the characters.  I don't understand why they don't have a group of people reading, each taking one character.  I'm tired of hearing the guy say ""He said"" over and over.  I'm even more tired of hearing a male voice portray a female character by changing to a really horrible imitation of a female voice.  Couldn't they hire a woman to read with him?  We hear the guy talk in a higher voice.  It is very poorly done.  What else is he going to do?  He can't make himself sound anything like a woman. There is only one interesting character in this story.  He is an employee of the sinister pig.  It falls to him to execute innocent girls.  The story progresses in the most expected way.  I could have written parts of the story line.  It is so obvious.  Is this good guy actually going to murder the girls?  Somehow I doubt it.  Are the good guys going to win in the end?  Yeah, I kind of think they will. So that's the lowdown on this book.

553,"I have read every Leaphorn/Chee book by Hillerman more than once and am a great fan. I just finished this book and discussed it with a friend.. we both agreed it was so disappointing.. we cannot believe it was written by the same person.

564,"I liked this ""book"", but as other reviewers mentioned, it is more of an idea magazine and not a step by step how to make cake pops book.  That said, it includes ideas for cookie pops, brownie pops and cake pops.  Though there is a section which covers making cake pop dough and different sizes of round pops, this book doesn't cover different flavors, different shapes (except pushing the dough through a tube) and decorating elements like candy, sprinkles, pretzels, etc. are not covered much at all. What is covered are cookie pops and brownie pops molded in Wilton molds, dipping pops into candy melted in a Wilton candy pro melting pot (microwaving not covered), pops dried in Wilton pop decorating stand (styrofoam not mentioned) and decorating using primarily Wilton candy sprinkles of all kinds and a lot of Wilton pre-rolled and tinted fondant.  Almost all the pops are round or molded in a Wilton mold. They also neglect to mention using a cookie scoop, a great way to get your cake pops all the same size.

565,"I have enjoyed Hillerman's novels for many years.  His strength is writing about the Navajo community and making Native American culture integral to plot resolution.  It is great when I can enjoy a light mystery novel and feel I have learned something about a culture I am not very familiar with.  I have counted on his accuracy since he seems to have the endorsement of the Navajo community to represent their culture in his books.  This book, with emphasis on Washington, a few mentions of Homeland Security and Osama bin Laden, takes him away from where I perceive his strengths to be. His characters always seem to lack depth.

571,"This is one of Tony Hillerman's weakest mysteries, but it's worth reading for a plot twist that will make it interesting for long-term Hillerman fans. I suggest, as others have, that you first read several of the earlier books in the series to get to know Jim Chee and Joe Leaphorn, the Navajo detectives who surely deserve a place in the hall of fame for fictional detectives.  You won't be able to appreciate fully this book without being familiar with the back story. Contrary to Hillerman's usual practice, most of the action in this book takes place off the Navajo reservation, way down in the New Mexico bootheel near the Mexican border. Hillerman's usual weaving of Indian culture into his mysteries is mostly absent.  Hillerman also preaches in this novel, a bit unusual for him.  He argues against the US war on drugs as futile and harmful and he exposes the theft of billions of dollars from Indian tribes by fraud in the payment of royalties on oil and gas revenues.

600,"Once again Tony lays out another vivid picture of New Mexico's enchanting lanscape. but this time the setting is the mysterious and lonely desert area of NM's boot heel. The characters are there. For the most part it reads like a typical Hillerman Leaphorn/Chee book but with an exception. The story is hurried along after a few chapters. It's like someone was bored and wanted to get the manuscript to the publishers quick and be done with it. All true Hillerman fans will read this book but I believe most will feel a bit cheated. It's a very short read even for a Hillerman. The beginning starts out with a perplexing and strange murder to solve but everything is unraveled quickly. I pretty much knew what to expect next from each character. The perfect chance to build suspense and a deep mystery was wasted by letting Joe Leaphorn solve everything way too quickly. It seems Joe only needs a few phone calls and a simple map to solve anything. The usually savy Chee and his intellegent cohort gal, now with another agency, are like bafoons relying mostly on the aging legendary Leaphorn to figure everything out. If you're a diehard Leaphorn/Chee fan like I am, you'll buy the book, even with its dissapointing 'not up to par' story. If it's your first one in the series, do yourself a huge favor. Read the first 15 before taking this one on. Otherwise you'll miss out on how good Hillerman can really be and might never bother to read the others.",1,"Once again Tony lays out another vivid picture of New Mexico's enchanting lanscape. but this time the setting is the mysterious and lonely desert area of NM's boot heel. The characters are there. For the most part it reads like a typical Hillerman Leaphorn/Chee book but with an exception. The story is hurried along after a few chapters. It's like someone was bored and wanted to get the manuscript to the publishers quick and be done with it. All true Hillerman fans will read this book but I believe most will feel a bit cheated. It's a very short read even for a Hillerman. The beginning starts out with a perplexing and strange murder to solve but everything is unraveled quickly. I pretty much knew what to expect next from each character. The perfect chance to build suspense and a deep mystery was wasted by letting Joe Leaphorn solve everything way too quickly. It seems Joe only needs a few phone calls and a simple map to solve anything. The usually savy Chee and his intellegent cohort gal, now with another agency, are like bafoons relying mostly on the aging legendary Leaphorn to figure everything out. If you're a diehard Leaphorn/Chee fan like I am, you'll buy the book, even with its dissapointing 'not up to par' story. If it's your first one in the series, do yourself a huge favor.

602,"I, like many of the other reviewers here, am a long standing fan of Tony Hillerman's mysteries featuring Joe ""The Legendary Lieutenant"" Leaphorn and Jim Chee.  I, also like many other reviewers, found __THE SINISTER PIG__ to be a compelling mystery. It carries through many themes from earlier Hillerman mysteries:  We have Sgt. Jim Chee of the Navajo Tribal Police, who is in love with Bernadette ""Bernie"" Manuelito, formerly of the Tribal Police, but now with the Border Patrol.  Chee is afraid to tell her of his feelings for fear of rejection.  We have the aforementioned Bernadette Manuuelito who is in love with Jim Chee, but also is afraid to express her love due to the same fear.  We have the now retired ""legendary Lieutenant"" with his ever-present maps and his analytical mind.  It's always a pleasure to meet these three again. We have a powerful businessman/criminal with money, political connections, and evil intentions who won't let anything or anyone stand in his way.  We have a couple of ex-C.I.A. agents, one who is operating incognito and is murdered almost as the book opens, and the other who is working for our amoral rich man. Throw all of these characters into a pot and mix them with the search for 40 billion or so dollars of missing royalties never paid to various indigenous tribes, the C.I.A. man's murder, and a drug smuggling plot, and you have a mystery (or perhaps mysteries) that requires the best of Leaphorn's analytical abilities and Chee's intuition to begin to get to the bottom of things. Well, that's the plot in a nutshell, and it does make a story well worth reading, but, there is something missing that I have come to anticipate in Hillerman's novels.  In the majority of his previous novels, he included, as an integral part of the plots, information that is not widely known about Navajo, or occasionally Hopi, customs, mythological history, and religious rites.  I always felt that I was getting a cultural education as well as reading a good mystery.  This unique aspect of his previous books was missing here, and I, for one, missed that aspect of his knowledge that he usually shares with us.

I have read every book he has written including all his Chee/Leaphorn books, his children's book, his coffee table book, his memoir, his non-fiction books, etc.  I even liked ""Finding Moon"".  Having said this, his last several Chee/Leaphorn books are delivering a diminishing return of enjoyment.  ""The Sinister Pig"" is an acceptable novel but without question the worst Chee/Leaphorn book to date. The books feel particularly strained in how Hillerman tries to bring all of the series characters (Chee, Leaphorn and Bernie) together in unlikely and implausible ways despite their natural separation by age, jobs and hundreds of miles.  What I most enjoy about Hillerman are his steady pacing, sense of the environment and interweaving of Navajo and western culture.  All of this is present in this novel.  What is missing is carefully plotting and crisp dialogue.",1,"I love Tony Hillerman.

617,"I gave THE SINISTER PIG 4 stars because, hey, it's part of a good series with very likeable characters and it is a page turner.  However, on other accounts it is lacking.  The strength of the Jim Chee/Joe Leaphorn mysteries has been character and cultural setting.  This time out, the story is plot-driven and largely takes place off the Four Corners Navajo reservation.  Much time is spent on the ""guest star"" characters and not so much on our old friends.  Thus, there is a thinness to this book despite a plot that starts off ambitiously snuffling up Washington corruption, post 9-11 paranoia, corrupt CEOs, drug smuggling, and other zeitgeist. The good news is, those who have read earlier entries in the series will be amused to find all of the other regulars finally losing patience with Jim Chee's romantic klutziness and variously taking him aside and essentially saying, look here, the time has come to get on with things.  Also, Hillerman takes what might be his best shot yet at satirizing the bureaucracy.  There is a great scene where the FBI, New Mexico State Police, Bureau of Land Management, DEA, and representatives of at least two other agencies are disputing jurisdiction and who should show up but Homeland Security, insisting on authority over everything and everybody.

The man has just retired from the CIA.  His employer is named Slate.  The amount not accounted for may be as high as forty billion.  Mankin is afraid he will stand out as he did not stand out in the Mideast when in the petroleum producing areas. Mankin checks with the Department of Energy. A sort of target has been identified, Rowley Winsor, a sinister pig, who may have political connections.  Winsor's grandfather made his money in liquor during Prohibition.  Winsor's character is illustrated by the fact that he has arranged to have a  Congressional intern killed because her pregnancy is an inconvenience to him. Jim Chee and FBI Agent Osborne learn that a dead man has been identified through the Visa card of Carl Mankin.  The Carl Mankin credit card is in the possession of Delbert Chinosa who received it from Albert Desboti.  Albert Desboti found the card in a billfold while cleaning a park.  A renatal automobile has alson surfaced miles away from the body and the wallet. Joe Leaphorn, retired, is contacted by Chee and others seeking to unravel the identity and the goals of the dead man.  Jim Chee finds a tie-in with information Bernadette Manuelito, a Customs Officer and his former employee, has discovered.  He drives south to see her.  It seems tht the dead man is really Gordon Stein.  Both the FBI and the CIA as his former employer and other forces are withholding pertinent information.  Bernadette Manuelito is in physical danger for having stumbled upon and photographed scenes yielding clues to the solution of the mystery.

With ""The Sinister Pig,"" unfortunately, it seems Mr. Hillerman is growing tired of his Leaphorn/Chee series.   The plot of ""The Sinister Pig,"" his latest in the series, is promising, but Hillerman seems to have lacked either the energy or the desire to flesh it out into what could have been a fantastic novel. Instead, what we get is a partially realized concept that clocks in at an anemic 240 pages. (And it's 240 heavily padded pages, at that, with blank pages between chapters, large type and heavy leading on the part of the typesetter. Let's face it: This is more a novella masquerading as a novel than the real thing.)   The book is also rife with proofing errors, including more missing question marks than one can count and at least one instance in which he accidentally refers to Chee as Leaphorn in mid-scene.

626,"Over the many novels in Hillerman's illustrious career, the readers have come to love the adventures of Joe Leaphorn and Jim Chee, however, the Sinister Pig seems to delve off onto a parallel tangent of the mysteries we've read for so long. While both characters are present, it seems as if Hillerman wanted to introduce something else besides yet another murder mystery, that is a little political commentary of his own.  The novel starts with a preface regarding missing royalties to the Indian Nations as it ties into oil profits and the U.S. government.  While I don't dispute his claims one way or another, Sinister Pig clearly is a vehicle for Hillerman to present his personal viewpoints in a fictional manner and to make the reader really aware of this. The story itself, while good, is missing the magical sense of Navajo country and traditions the readers have come to expect from Hillerman.  Gone are the beautiful descriptions of the four corners area, and the deep culture of the Native Americans.  Instead we find Jim Chee at a mid life crisis, contemplating his life as a bachelor and his love for former Officer Bernie Manuelito. Joe Leaphorn is present as well, but his character steps down as a main player to that of the supporting cast.  And while Leaphorn has his momentous 'breakthrough' in the case, his involvement otherwise is minimal. However, who does step up to the plate is Bernie Manuelito.  Now as a Border Patrol Officer assigned to lower New Mexico, she stumbles across a corrupt department, and some 'fishy' on-goings at the nearby Tuttle Ranch.  Something in regards to drugs, gas and oil pipelines, illegal immigration, the apparent murders of undercover government officials and of course and errant and deviant U.S. government. The novel is pretty fast paced and is a very quick read.  Chapters are small and to the point.  It was a good diversion for a Hillerman book, but I hope this was just a half way point to a much larger novel that will bring our characters back to the forefront of Native American culture and its roots in northern New Mexico.",1,"Over the many novels in Hillerman's illustrious career, the readers have come to love the adventures of Joe Leaphorn and Jim Chee, however, the Sinister Pig seems to delve off onto a parallel tangent of the mysteries we've read for so long.

Hillerman seems to have decided that since he has written so much of Navajo ceremonies and the nature of the people, that he doesn't have to tell us any more.  I felt a great lack of what I enjoy most.  I also felt that the book lurched along from an unprepossessing start in Washington D. C. through a series of events that never quite explained everything.  I expected more to be said of the ripoff of royalties for gas and oil, because it seemed to be introduced as an important problem early on.

I expected more to be said of the ripoff of royalties for gas and oil, because it seemed to be introduced as an important problem early on.  This won't stop me from reading the next thing Hillerman writes, but I hope the next one is more organic in structure and contains the old poetic quality when he writes of the people and the land."

638,"Bernie Manulito (sp?) and Cowboy Dashee have joined the ranks of federal law enforcement officers and both figure prominently in this story.  In a less gifted author, it would all seem too convenient but Hillerman's writing is seamless.   Bernie has taken another job to get away from Jim Chee and what she perceives to be his ambivalence toward her.  As a border patrol agent, she stumbles across some illegal activity which places her danger.  This danger gives her an opportunity for more action in the book and gives Jim a reason to seek her out.   Meanwhile Jim Chee is miserable without her but does not know what to do about it.  Both Joe Leaphorn and Cowboy Dashee become involved in the mystery, and the people who pose the biggest threat to Bernie are taken down in the end.  There is a pleasant surprise in the take-down scene.   This was a delightful story that goes by much too quickly.  It seems shorter than his other novels, but I liked it much more than the last one he wrote.  I only gave it four stars because he has written other novels I like more that I would give five stars to, but taken by itself and not in comparison with his other novels, I'd give it five stars.   Hillerman is by far one of the best novelists of our time.  I dread the thought of his last book and with every new book, I fear it will be his last.  I have learned a great deal about Navajo history, culture and religion from his books while having a good time with the mysteries therein.",0,"Bernie Manulito (sp?) and Cowboy Dashee have joined the ranks of federal law enforcement officers and both figure prominently in this story.

652,"As a longtime fan of Tony Hillerman's mystery series involving Navajo policemen Joe Leaphorn, Jim Chee, and now Bernie Manuelito, I picked this one up based purely on name recognition. As I read the book, however, I began to wonder if it had actually been written by Hillerman. The plot involves Washington, D.C. politicos involved in drug-running between Mexico and the U.S. There is some soap-boxing about missing royalties owed Native American tribes from the U.S. government, and a couple honorable assassins thrown in to spice things up. The setup is interesting enough, with a man sent out to the Four Corners region to do some investigating, shot in the back, and then a follow-up investigation by Sgt. Jim Chee. Meanwhile, Chee's would-be girlfriend has become Border Patrol Officer Manuelito down in the bootheel of New Mexico. In fact, most of the action in the story is done by Bernie, although Leaphorn figures out most of the details with his powers of deduction and a couple maps. Chee just kind of ties things together. What disappointed me is that although the characters are moving along, the spirit seems to have gone out of Hillerman's writing. The vivid details of the landscape and geography are missing, along with the spirituality of Chee. Most of the Navajo cultural notes that made the earlier novels interesting are just kind of hinted at and it is assumed that the reader has read the other works. If this was the first Hillerman mystery I picked up, I would probably skip the rest.",1,"As a longtime fan of Tony Hillerman's mystery series involving Navajo policemen Joe Leaphorn, Jim Chee, and now Bernie Manuelito, I picked this one up based purely on name recognition.

654,"As I read this book, the thought that kept intruding that Tony Hillerman is no longer young (he'll be 78 this year). I strongly suspect that this book, which comes so strongly on the heels of  ""The Wailing Wind,"" may well be his last.   Other reviewers have noted that this book adds nothing new to our understanding of the central characters. But it does leave them with fewer unresolved issues than prior books. Rather than being the cynical money-making effort depicted in some reviews below, this book appears to be a parting gift from an aging author who wanted to give the series a more satisfying closure than ""The Wailing Wind"" had left us with. That said, it's not a great stand-alone book. The first chapter, which introduces the retiring CIA agent who will soon become the murder victim, is painfully cliched, seemingly cobbled together from bad spy movies and political thrillers. The mystery is obvious (partly because huge chunks of it are told from the villains' perspective), and except for a little bit of magic with maps, Leaphorn and Chee get no chance to show off their detecting brilliance. The setting, in southern New Mexico's ""boot heel"" region, is rendered generically, without the detail for which Hillerman is famous-as though he'd written it from maps and memory. Plot elements never connect, and there are gaps in the police procedure (most notably involving a car, which is missing in one chapter but has been fingerprinted in another chapter, with no mention that I could find of its being discovered). The cobbled-together feel of this book, its lack of complexity, and its short length make me suspect that Hillerman's health is failing and that he rushed it to completion while he still could. Hopefully I'm wrong. Regardless, readers of the series this book should save this book for last-it's merely an epilog to a long and honorable series. If you've read all the books, this one is a must read. If you've not, you'll be disappointed.

657,"Unless you are an absolutely die hard fan -- save your money.  Otherwise, this book is bound to be a disappointment.  The villain is utterly implausible, much of the plot centers in D.C. and Chee and Leaphorn are peripheral to the story. I have to say that I usually enjoy Hillerman for the descriptions of the landscape and insights into Navajo culture as much as the mystery itself.  This time, however, the plot is so implausible and the writing so flat that it detracted from the usual pleasures.  I also have to say, having lived in Washington, DC for the past 12 years, that I found the portions of the book dealing with DC and federal politics completely absurd.  In fact, Mr. Hillerman so misunderstands the DC political game and his villain is painted in such broad strokes that it made me wonder whether his descriptions of Navajo culture are equally bogus and inaccurate.  By the end of the book, I had come to question all his descriptions. I also have to agree with all those who criticized the writing in this book.  Many of the scenes read like outlines, particularly in the later chapters.  I've noticed that mystery writers with long established series frequently get lazy with the later books in the series (see Martha Grimes), but I do not understand why the publisher or editor does not insist that sparse scenes be fleshed out and that authors adhere to modicum of versimilitude.  I know that the authors of Hillerman's stature will make money no matter how dreadful the writing but I would think the embarassment factor would kick in.",1,"Unless you are an absolutely die hard fan -- save your money.

660,"Tony Hillerman does a bit of traveling away from the Navajo Reservation in this outing.  Officer Bernadette Manuelito has forsaken the tribal police for a job in the southern most regions of New Mexico, where she is training on the job to be a border patrol agent.  Although she is still in love with Jim Chee, she sees only hurt and complications in staying so decides to move on and find solace in her work.  Sgt. Chee is much better at police business than he is at expressing the personal stuff in his life, so poor Bernie is under the impression that the attraction she feels is never going to be reciprocated and she needs to get on with her life. Meanwhile, back on the res, a body turns up that is causing a lot more than the usual interest by federal agents.  There is no identification on the body but the FBI immediately snatches the case from the local jurisdiction of the tribal police and all inquiries from the locals for progress in the case get a response of ""this isn't your problem.""  Of course, Jim Chee is even more curious when he starts getting that answer and begins to hunt for information on his own. Retired Lieutenant Joe Leaphorn gets drawn into the same puzzle of the unidentified dead man by a different route.  As usual, he gives insight based on his considerable years on the force dealing with both criminals and the bureaucracy. And in a final, bizarre twist, Officer Bernie (200 miles to the south of the reservation) finds a piece of the puzzle that has Jim heading down to the border for a visit and a feeble attempt at talking Bernie into coming home.  Trouble is, Chee, the great problem solver can't untangle his feelings for this beautiful Navajo girl.  Since his past relationships have always ended badly, he has no hope that this young woman just might be his perfect compliment, so unconsciously keeps pushing her away. But, personal relationships aside, the Sinister Pig moves inexorably toward an explosive final solution, tying all the strange coincidences and loose ends into a very nicely wrapped, well planned mystery. It all sounds complicated, but in Hillerman's deft hands, The Sinister Pig becomes completely plausible and thoroughly enjoyable.",1,"Tony Hillerman does a bit of traveling away from the Navajo Reservation in this outing.

Chee doesn't think so, but he doesn't know where to take it until he gets a letter from Bernie Manuelito--now a border patrol officer. Bernie has seen strange things on the border but when her boss takes her picture and then that picture shows up in drug runners' offices, she knows she is in trouble. She may value her independence, but she knows when she's in over her head and she is. With a little help from Lt. Joe Leaphorn, Chee untangles a mystery that involves a missing $40 billion of Bureau of Indian Affairs royalty money and the U.S./Mexico drug smuggling business. Whether he'll unravel the clues in time to save Bernie is another question. Tony Hillerman fans will be overjoyed to see a new mystery featuring the wonderful Chee and Leaphorn. Both men are still struggling with their love interests, unable to quite put things together, suddenly inarticulate in the presence of the women they love. THE SINISTER PIG takes the mystery largely off the reservation and so misses out on the Native American culture and religion that provides such a depth to many of Hillerman's earlier Chee and Leaphorn novels. Hillerman is cynical about the war on drugs, recognizing that its biggest supporters include the smugglers themselves--criminals who would be out of business if drugs were legalized and who are willing to do virtually anything to prevent this disaster. As always in Hillerman novels, the FBI is treated as incompetent and corrupt at the D.C. level, even as it sends its most talented agents into the hinterland. Hillerman also takes a dig at the Department of Homeland Security, recognizing that adding a layer of bureaucracy may not be the best way to improve safety.

Then too, the characters we have come to love, Jim Chee, Joe Leaphorn and even the interloping Cowboy Dashee as well as Jim Chee's latest heartbreaker, Bernie Manuelito, are center stage. So why the grousing. Perhaps Hillerman fans expected more fireworks after the two most recent clunkers. Or maybe, with the same cast in place, readers expected Hillerman to continue his exploration and exposition of the cultures of the native peoples of the southwest. But as Hillerman moves his action further south, he leaves much of the Navaho ethos behind, and the distinct customs of a people fade as the writer brings the Sonoran landscape to the foreground. Tellingly it is described as even more vacant, more of a vacuum of living things than the ""Four Corners"" setting of earlier novels. Bernie, now with the Customs Patrol carries extra plastic jugs of water in her vehicle, and she will need them as she discovers thirsty illegals stranded in the desert. Principal characters getting lost because of undistinguishable landmarks ( unthinkable on Navaho land ) leads  more than once to important plot turns. Readers similarly may be exploring new and unfamiliar territory which is a bit more uncomfortable because of the presence of the familiar in different roles. If this is not classic Hillerman, it is still very good Hillerman, a differently focused Hillerman, and an entertaining read.",1,"This novel demonstrates the spare, elegant prose and tight plot that characterizes Hillerman at his best - as in Blessing Way or Dark Wind.

Principal characters getting lost because of undistinguishable landmarks ( unthinkable on Navaho land ) leads  more than once to important plot turns. Readers similarly may be exploring new and unfamiliar territory which is a bit more uncomfortable because of the presence of the familiar in different roles. If this is not classic Hillerman, it is still very good Hillerman, a differently focused Hillerman, and an entertaining read."

675,"It's quite clear that Tony Hillerman has squeezed the last ounce of blood from this turnip. You know he's run out of ideas for his venerable Native American heroes when he's more interested in the villains of the book than the cops. This book, definitely the worst in the series, is as flat as a pancake from start to finish, with a ""mystery"" as complex as an Encyclopedia Brown story. Chee and Leaphorn have basically nothing to do in this story except pass on endless, awkward exposition. Side characters slide in and out with no real purpose. The only cop who Hillerman seems to be interested in, the fetching Bernie Manuelito, becomes a helpless pawn in a macho boy's game of drugs and power. Even Hillerman's trademark Ansel Adams-esque descriptions of the southwestern scenery seem minimized and irrelevant. Hillerman can't even figure out how to end it properly, resorting to a horridly uncharacteristic ""epilogue"" that seems like it was written two hours before deadline. This series really does have a lot of legs in it, but Hillerman no longer seems to have the energy to keep it moving. Perhaps it's time for someone else to take over with Hillerman serving as consultant.

678,"This book seems to be Tony Hillerman attempting to masquerade as James Patterson. Some familiar characters, a murder and related violence, short chapters, almost continual action and extremely limited character development. (Eliminate the many blank pages between chapters and it is barely two hundred small pages of large type. Thus, it is overpriced.) The story has great potential. It has the well known characters of Sergeant Jim Chee of the Navajo Tribal Police and Bernie Manuelito, now separated geograpically from Chee as a rookie Border Patrol officer and with the future of their relationship in doubt. When a puzzling murder in Chee's jurisdiction intersects with Bernie's work, the retired ""Legendary Lieutenant "" Joe Leaphorn is called upon for consultation. At the same time there seems to be a puzzling interest emanating from a powerful source in Washington, D.C. concerning the ramifications of the case. There is an intimation that the dead man may have been investigating the actual scandal concerning the loss (probably due to a combination of theft, embezzlement, indifference and incompetence) of billions of dollars of royalties from the Indian Tribal Royalty Fund held in trust by the Department of the Interior. This is a topic with great potential for an author with Hillerman's skills and knowledge, but it becomes peripheral to a pretty standard police procedural combined with the mystery of how the romance between Bernie and Jim will conclude. There is some excellent misdirection regarding both the nature of the underlying crinimal activity and its participants and who or what is the real ""SINISTER PIG"". But a lot of the oppportunities to develop the potential plot complications and resultant suspense were simply never pursued. Also, there were several loose ends that were never satisfactorily tied up despite the attempt to do so in the epilogue. (I cannot go into details without revealing too much of the plot.) It is almost as if Hillerman had an outline for a wonderfully complex story and then decided it was too complicated and so decided to quickly bring this part of the story to a close and leave the rest for a sequel. As the title of my review implies, a few elements helped me decide to generously round up my rating to three stars. First, the plot is clever, and there is sufficient misdirection to keep the reader's interest. Second, it involves familiar characters. Third, this is a incredibly fast read. It is definitely a book for a short trip or a rainy afternoon.

683,"OK, I thought, ""The Wailing Wind"" was an aberration, a hiccup in the career of a very good author.  But two points define a line, and ""The Sinister Pig"" plots Mr. Hillerman's career straight down.  In the corporate world you sometimes see a luminary from an earlier era who is ""RIP"" -- retired in place -- just going through the motions, living on past glories and collecting the big bucks for his reputation, not his current work.  Sadly, this describes Tony Hillerman, who has decided to stir around a few ashes, thow in a highly predictable conclusion, and call it a novel.  I bet he's laughing at his readers all the way to the bank. As for the book itself, reviewers occasionally describe a film as ""OK for a 10-minute sketch on SNL, but not a 90-minute feature.""  That's Sinister Pig for you: interesting premise but almost no plot or character development (call central casting for all the stereotypes), no suspense (you know from the start who's really a bad guy and who's really not), and the shallowest of literary style (like Wailing Wind, everyone is constantly ""grinning"" at everyone else).  The initial plot device, investigating diversion of Indian royalty payments, is both interesting and topical -- it's really happening -- but couldn't lead to a facile wrap-up in a mere 224 pages, so Mr. Hillerman switches to just another standard contraband tale.  Rest assured, the good guys prosper, the bad guys pay, and the bad guys who are really good guys ... well, what do you expect? I did like the little polemics on stealing of Indian royalties, the vested interest of both narcos and narcs in keeping the ""War on Drugs"" going full steam, and the pervasiveness of corruption in high office, but they weren't enough to salvage an otherwise trivial work.

It does not take place on the Navajo Reservation, neither Chee nor Leaphorn is really involved in the crime, and the crime really has nothing to do with Navajo culture in any way. In fact, the effort to involve them comes off as contrived. While Bernie is more of a central character, she is a weak central character. All we find out about her is that she is sad and misses Jim Chee. We don't even get to see her as a very professional cop. The most interesting character is actually Budge (a hatchet man for a cartoonish Very Bad Rich Guy). If only the novel had been written about him, from his viewpoint, it could have been great. As it was, it was just an OK but forgettable standard cop/mystery story. It couldn't even decide if it was going to be a story about exploitation of Indian resources or about smuggling drugs. And while I support legalization of most drugs, the discussion of that in the book was heavyhanded and simplistic. It really seemed as though Hillerman had a bunch of topics and series plot developments on a checklist, but was searching for a real novel to slip them into.

689,"I am a huge Tony Hillerman fan -- I've read each of his novels multiple times and have enjoyed all of them.  My favorites are Dance Hall of the Dead and Skinwalkers. The Sinister Pig, simply put, is an awful book, and is not even close to the level Hillerman has set for himself.  Much of the action takes place on airplanes and in limousines, and next to nothing occurs anywhere close to the Navajo reservation.  Hillerman tries to introduce the flavor of the New Mexico/Mexico border region, but his descriptions do not even come close to the standard he set for the Four Corners area.  Had I not been to this area many times myself (I grew up in Arizona) I wouldn't be able to distinguish the border region from Kentucky.  Finally, the subtlety and grace of earlier Hillerman character interaction -- Leaphorn and Emma, Chee and Mary Landon, and so on -- has been blown away by a sudden urge by Hillerman to make everything explicit.  Yes, Tony, we know Chee loves Bernie and Bernie loves Chee -- why do you have to pound it in to us in every single scene? This book was, simply put, painful to read, and I wouldn't have finished it at all were I not such a big Hillerman fan.  If you are new to Hillerman, please please please do not begin with this poor work.  And if you haven't read every Hillerman novel, probably multiple times, my advice is to put this one aside and go back to those books you haven't read, or haven't read in a while.  I really wonder, seriously, if Hillerman farmed this out to some ghost writer -- it really has the feel of some poor shmuck trying to mimic Hillerman's characters....... it's sad, because I had really hoped that Tony had one or two good novels still left in him, but if The Sinister Pig is any indication, he doesn't.

The story line as noted in other reviews was weak and thin to say the least. Character development was left at the sketch level, and the plot was not supported by the narrative. Several examples of this include the plot line between Chee and Officer Bernadette Manuelito. It was simplified to the point where all we read about was his yearning for her, and her for him. The level of which was dime store at best. Secondly, in trying to tie all the lead character's in, we find ourselves jumping from one simple story line connection to another. Chee to Leaphorn to Bernadette Manuelito, to an unknown power broker in Washington, etc. The resolution of the story lines would have better off in a typical weekly tv show. Since when did we see in a Hillerman book, the paid killer letting his feelings get the better of him and saving both Bernadette Manuelito and the Senator's girlfriend.

Hillerman has masterfully evolved both of these characters over the past couple of decades, introducing Leaphorn, then Chee, and having them meet at respectful loggerheads and gradually develop a mutual admiration as their respective worlds evolve and change. Hillerman has done this so well that one would think he had everything planned out before he even set the first word to paper lo those many years ago, though that seems impossible. No matter. Hillerman remains unrivaled in his ability to capture the people and culture --- and the nuances of both --- of the American Southwest. THE SINISTER PIG, Hillerman's latest novel, finds Leaphorn adjusting to retirement and life as a widower, while Jim Chee investigates the mysterious death of a stranger on the edge of the Jicarella Apache natural gas field. Though the Navajo Tribal Police have jurisdiction, the FBI quickly moves in and classifies the incident as a hunting accident. Chee, however, is not satisfied. The victim was not dressed for hunting and was stripped of identification. The proximity of his body to the natural gas field indicates that he might have been investigating charges that billions of dollars from the sale of gas have been embezzled from the Indian Tribal royalty trust. But if that was the case, for whom was he conducting the investigation? The stakes become personal for Chee as he finds that photographs taken by Bernie Manuelito may have some bearing on the matter. Manuelito, a former member of Chee's squad and now with the Border Patrol, took the photos in the course of her investigation of suspicious activity around a ranch in southern New Mexico. She is unaware, however, that her photographs tie in with Chee's case and put her in terrible danger from an unexpected source. Chee must rely on his own knowledge, as well as Leaphorn's wise counsel and connections, if he is to resolve the mystery of the dead stranger and save Manuelito's life. THE SINISTER PIG contains all of the elements that Hillerman is known for --- the interplay between Leaphorn and Chee, the strong characterization, and the intimate knowledge of Indian tribal culture and relationships. Chee is a particularly subtle delight here, as he struggles to come to grips with his feelings for Manuelito and his almost painful inability to articulate them. The most significant aspect of THE SINISTER PIG, however, is the villain of the piece who gives this novel its name. A sinister pig is one who has more than he or she can use, but still wants more. The shadowy Rawley Winsor, in this case, is the sinister pig, and he is one of the more interesting adversaries you'll encounter in literature this year. And his assistant, the enigmatic Budge, practically makes the book all by himself. One almost gets the feeling that THE SINISTER PIG could easily have been twice the length of its 224 pages, that the story wants to burst out of its binding with more that could be told. Regardless, THE SINISTER PIG remains a worthy addition to Hillerman's canon.   --- Reviewed by Joe Hartlaub",1,"It's not on the agenda for this year, or even next year, but while I still have all of my wits about me, I want to sit down and read all of Tony Hillerman's Joe Leaphorn and Jim Chee novels in chronological order.

710,"In ""The Sinister Pig,"" Tony Hillerman tackles more universal concerns.  His Navajo Reservation gang is up to its elbows in trying to solve yet another homicide.  This time, it's a mysterious agent whose death extends clues in numerous directions, not the least to the very center of America itself, Washington D.C. Hillerman's action takes place almost entirely off the Reservation.  The complicated web he has woven involves primarily the drug trade, massive fraud by oil and gas organizations, and the smuggling of illegal aliens across the Mexican border.  Hillerman has chosen to take his socially significant themes to a much broader horizon and readers may feel they're reading from a daily newspaper (lately described as ""America's newest fiction form!"") editorial page.  Still, the issues he present couldn't be more relevant. Granted, he takes care of his established characters. The Legendary Joe Leaphorn contributes heavily and Jim Chee faces a complicated and complex set of personal struggles: his relationship with Bernie, his responsibility to his native culture, and his loyalty to his job.  Hillerman has no problem with any of this, yet ""The Sinister Pig"" seems to move at a pace unusually fast for the author.  This book seems to concentrate on action rather than devote much time to personal philosophy and Navajo culture.

713,"I just wish Tony Hillerman could write faster. I seem to need a dose of a new book by him about twice a year. His books featuring Leaphorn and Chee, for me, are the best of the lot, so Sinister Pig goes right to the top of the list. Here's the thing: Hillerman and his editors KNOW anything he writes is going to sell like thermal longjohns in Alaska. But still, his books read like they've actually been edited and checked and coddled a bit. Sinister Pig deals with murder - of course - dum-de-dum-dum: otherwise, it wouldn't be a Hillerman mystery. It also deals with lots and lots of $$$ missing from the Tribal Trust, drugs, greed, and hanky-panky on the 'rez.' I just wish Janet Whatzername, Chee's first love interest, hadn't vanished from the series so early... Here comes Bernadette Manuelito, however, to take up the slack. Don't miss it - but here's the thing lots of casual readers don't realize: You can take a Hillerman book, a topographical map of the Four Corners area, and a 4-wheel drive vehicle, and actually track down every single rock and arroyo and mesa and creek that's mentioned.

716,"Not since FINDING MOON have I been so disappointed in Tony Hillerman. When I buy a Hillerman book, I don't want to read about an evil, faceless puppetmaster who pulls string in Washington and wrecks havoc in the Jim Chee and Joe Leaphorn's 'four corners' of the world. I want to read about problems on the reservation...or difficulties within the Navajo Tribal Police...or about how the native Americans are trying to preserve their ancient knowledge.....or about how Joe Leaphorn is finding a new life after the death of his beloved wife...or about how Jim Chee can't ever get it right with women.  I also want the book to be more than 240 pages.  This story felt like formula fiction, something Hillerman has avoided up to now. The story about siphoned off oil and gas probably needs to be told, but I think a non-fiction expose would be a better venue for unveiling what could possibly be the biggest heist in history. I had another issue with the story.  I never for one minute believed the author's reasoning behind Bernadette Mauelito's leaving the Navajo Tribal Police for a job with the Board Patrol.  Bernie was too close to her family/clan to move to the Mexican border.  It was completely out of character for her.  I would have understood a 'temporary assignment' with the feds, but having her choose to make that kind of radical move just never felt right. For Jim Chee fans, the book does contain a pleasant surprise.  I look forward to seeing how Chee handles it in the next story. This is not Hillerman's best -- but after so many good ones, he's due a hiccup.",1,"Not since FINDING MOON have I been so disappointed in Tony Hillerman.

And Chee and Leaphorn, as  well as  the ever-appealing Cowboy Dashee, seem  like minor characters in what turns out to be a fairly stock spy/thriller caper, with a bad guy so bad he's  almost comic.

725,"It is always wonderful to open another Hillerman and follow the latest law enforcement adventure in the Four Corners.  Meeting up with Jim Chee and Joe Leaphorn is just like meeting up with old friends.  And reading this newest Hillerman brings one quite up-to-date with each of the men, their current love life, and their efforts to solve a mystery of international intrigue. This is not Hillerman's best novel, but one can forgive him because he does present a fast page turner and educates along the way.  Chee's romantic interest, Bernie Manuelito has gone to work for the Feds in the Border Patrol, and unlikely as it may seem, she becomes linked to a murder in the Four Corners. The pig involved takes on several meanings, but would be especially familiar to anyone in the pipeline trade.  The double meaning, of course, indicates the greed that leads to corruption within governmental bodies. This tale involves Washington, D. C. subterfuge, and enlists the Navajo Tribal Police,  U. S. Bureau of Land Management, U. S. Border Patrol,  the F. B. I., and the Office of Homeland Security.  Hillerman skillfully sets his tale in the midst of the real world worries of the 21st century. Will ""third time's charm"" work for Chee in his stumbling romance with Bernadette?  The romance and the mystery intertwine for a comfortable quick read and satisfying solution. Can't wait for the next Hillerman in order to meet up Leaphorn and Chee once more.

728,"The Sinister Pig is one of Tony Hillerman's deftest plots and best designed stories.  Be careful not to read reviews that tell too much of the plot, or much of the book's pleasure will be needlessly spoiled for you.  Some will not like this story as much as previous ones because it moves into new ground, both geographically and story-telling-wise.  Having that reaction is like failing to appreciate the latest model of Ferrari while being totally fixated on the 1950s versions.  Be open to the evolution of Mr. Hillerman's skill and the potential of his characters. Because this book relies so much on past character development to establish its story, it would be a major mistake to make this the first book you read in the series.  If you start with this book, the big mystery will be finding out who all of the people are and why the story involves them.  I think this is one of those series where you really should start at the beginning and work on from there. This story is told from the perspective of several different characters, none of whom know everything that is going on.  As the reader, you are privy to more of their thoughts and knowledge than any of them have which helps you anticipate what will happen next.  Yet, until near the end, the ultimate meanings of the book's title will be hidden from you.  It's a nice job of misdirection and a gradual, tasty unpeeling of the story grape. Neither Jim Chee nor Joe Leaphorn are the center of this story, although they play major roles.  This is Bernie Manuelito's story although she doesn't appear in the book's opening.  She has left some of her frustrations with Jim Chee and the Navajo Tribal Police to join the U.S. Customs Border Patrol near the border of Arizona and New Mexico.  This takes her 200 miles from the reservation, and she's lonely despite making friends there.  She alternates pining for Jim and being annoyed by his seeming aloofness in letters.  He misses her desperately, but cannot bring himself to do anything about it.  Bernie finds her new job emotionally and physically challenging because it involves both stopping illegal immigrants who may be in trouble after being abandoned by the coyote guides who lead them and dangerous drug smugglers who will stop at nothing to get their valuable, illegal cargoes through. In the background to the story are a mysterious investigation of misappropriation of billions in royalties due to Tribal Trust Funds from oil and gas sales, an unexplained death which the FBI hushes up, a Washington power broker who desperately wants the war on drugs to continue, former CIA agents and operatives, blackmail, a missing mistress, an exotic game ranch, an investigative reporter, and unexplained construction in the middle of nowhere. The book's only flaw is that the villain is portrayed in terms that are a little too extreme to be credible.  He's more like a James Bond foe than a Tony Hillerman criminal. The overall theme of this book is about how our misperceptions of what is going on are likely to lead us astray.  These misperceptions may be based on differences in language and culture, knowing only parts of the facts, having facts be withheld from us, or by assuming what others tell us is true when it is not.  Mr. Hillerman does a masterful job of portraying all of these problems, and showing that it is important that we act on our desire to know more . . . rather than being satisfied with what appears to be going on at the surface.  Better solutions are at hand, if only we grasp them. After you finish this fine book, I suggest that you think about where you may be misperceiving the potential around you.  How can you test the accuracy and completeness of those perceptions where it's important?

This one is a very rapid read, with much of the action happening away from the Navajo reservation (Always a bad move, Tony). The plot centers around the murder of a retired CIA operative who's investigating the theft of billions of dollars in Indian oil, gas, coal, and timber royalties for a United States senator.  Bernie Manuelito has taken a job with the border patrol to get away from Jim Chee, her pushy boss, when she stumbles across a suspicious construction project in the middle of the desert. Unknowingly, she has become embroiled in a smuggling operation and her picture is being spread around by Mexican drug traffickers as a DEA agent to be on the lookout for. Meanwhile, Chee is pining away for Bernie, trying to think of a reason to go get her and ask her to marry him. This is where Joe Leaphorn enters the picture. He gets out his maps and is able to tie the original murder scene to some abandoned oil and gas pipelines leading from Sonora, Mexico, to the site of the murder. The Sinister Pig of the title is a device used to clean the insides of the pipelines. Joe quickly grasps the possibilities.  Hillerman uses multiple viewpoints to help us follow the action. There's a billionaire drug smuggler, his former CIA pilot (the most interesting character in the book), and a corrupt border patrol supervisor and of course our friends Joe, Jim, and Bernie.  I'd be surprised if this book is over 70,000 words it reads so fast. I liked a couple of things about it, besides Chee and Leaphorn of course, two of the best characters in the mystery genre: the factual basis of the book, the royalty money which the Department of the Interior lost or stole and the great character, Budge C. de Baca, the billionaire's pilot, a romantic felon I haven't seen anywhere else. I also like Cowboy Dashee, a recurring character in the Leaphorn/Chee series, who is now working for the Bureau of Land Management. He and Chee add comic relief to what might otherwise be a pretty conventional mystery.",1,"I hadn't been expecting to hear from Tony Hillerman again so soon.

There is one main causes to this.  The casing in incorrect. It's too loose to fit properly and make a clean connection to the contacts. This results in the PS2 recognizing the card about 2% of the time. So don't buy this. Just go get an official 8MB.

The tin can easily fit into a pocket or purse & one can pass time by using the inside as a ""board"" while waiting (e.g. a doctor's office). The print 'sticker' stays on well & the magnets were easy to pull apart without tearing. Overall, I am happy with my purchase and would recommend.

947,"Works exactly as advertised. Bought these along with a 2-pack of controllers for the GameCube, as my TV is a ways away from my couch and i wanted to play multi-player with my wife. The controller plugs into the extension cable about as snugly as the controller (and the other end of the extension cable) plugs into the GameCube, which is to say plenty snug enough to keep it in while moving the controller and cable around semi-violently, but not snug enough to keep a controller attached after being thrown across the room (just an example). One major concern I did have when I bough these was the possibility of lag due to the signal from the controller having to travel farther. This concern was unwarranted, as I have noticed no difference in response time either way. On durability, I've had these for almost 2 years and they haven't shown any noticeable signs of wear. Throw in a reasonable price ($4 when I bought it from Amermedia in 2012) and this is a heck of a deal for people that need a product like this. I would recommend.",0,"Works exactly as advertised.

Everyday I wrap the cords back up around the controller and tuck it away.  All that twisting of the cords has had no effect on the connectors.  They operate just great.  The 2 pack was enough for me to sit about 15 feet back from the console and still have slack.

Hook 1 of these extensions up to each controller and problem solved.

They even work for Bongos so that is a nice feature to be able to move the bongos back as well for those games.,1,I bought 2 sets of this product (so 4 cables total). I was not disappointed.

1104,"Let's not mince words here: Clayfighter 63 1/3 is a poorly put-together game. The game had a lot of possibilities, but everything lacks polish. Characters are missing frames of animation, backgrounds look decent but unexceptional, and the fighting engine lacks the strategy of Street Fighter, the speed of Killer Instinct, or the playability of Mortal Kombat. In any normal world, this would be a one star game. Except somewhere along the way, Clayfighter 63 1/3 is so bad that it actually becomes good. Character design is pretty good, and the special moves and taunts are hilarious. The game is playable - not in any way that it can compete with the above-mentioned games, but it still makes you want to come back for another round, if just to see all the things the characters can do. There's also a bit more value once you unlock the secret characters, though it's frustrating that there's no save function that keeps these character unlocked. Certainly not worth full retail price, but the N64 is dead now so you should be able to snag this game for dirt cheap. Also be on the lookout for the Sculptor's Cut version: this was a Blockbuster-only release, but most were sold off as pre-played games.

1116,"Back in 1993, a little game called Myst appeared. Everyone went crazy for  it -- it featured amazing graphics, addicting search and explore gameplay,  and it was actually educational. A main part of the game was reading, so it  figures that many parents were so supportive of it. It was also, though,  terribly spooky at times. You could be anywhere in the world of Myst and  still feel a general sense of... well, spookiness. But Myst was in 1993  -- and even though it held well throughout several years (which is  amazingly good), it started to be noticed more as a classic than current  technology. So how well can ""Riven: The Sequel To Myst"" hold up  against ""current technology"" and the original classic? By simply  making the adventure more intresting, more long, and with more  ""spookiness"" -- an original Myst-cliche that adds drama to the  game. ""Riven"" is even more rewarding than ""Myst"" so  much to the fact that it is sometimes speechless. There's five CDs to the  game -- that's clearly enough for anyone to buy this game. Even as it  starts out, you better look for clues. The developers made it so that if  you do not look for enough information, you could go from one disc to  another in less than 20 minutes. The graphics, while nice, aren't the  best in the world. Even the control (using the Playstation controller) is  sometimes sticky. But believe me, you'll get used to it.

1121,"I still remember when I first bought this game back in 1997.  It was when I first got my PS and I wasn't disappointed. The graphics were pretty crisp and clear and it had a nice little selection of playable characters including Spiderman, Iron Man, The Hulk, Psylocke, Wolverine and others.  For those who played Marvel vs. Capcom 2 before this one, the movement may feel a little slow to you.  However, this was the first of the Marvel vs. Capcom style games so don't expect it to be as good as MVC2. The default controls for this game are the easiest to work with of any of the Marvel titles.  You'll find it easy to learn and it fits the PS controller perfectly.  Air combos can be pulled off easily but it may take a while for some to learn how to do them. On this game you'll find that the characters hyper combos are much more powerful than they are on MVC2.  However, since this was the first of these type of fighter games, the characters have less moves to execute.  The thing that really separates this game from all of the others is the Gems.  There are 6 Gems that you may use during battle and different ones have different effects on certain characters.  For example when Juggernaut uses the space gem, he turns silver and gains super armor.  When Psylocke uses the Power gems she creates 3 copies of herself so then it's like fighting 3 of them at once.  The final boss on this game is Thanos.  He's better than the boss on the other Marvel titles because he's actually a challenge.  He automatically starts the match with all 6 gems and he also has 6 different hyper combos he can do with each gem.  Also this game actually has endings for the characters and the music is superior to all of the other titles except for Marvel vs. Street Fighter. I recommend you buy this game if you can find it for a reasonable price.  You won't be disappointed.  It may seem outdated for those who played MVC2 before playing this but it's still enjoyable.",1,"I still remember when I first bought this game back in 1997.

Air combos can be pulled off easily but it may take a while for some to learn how to do them. On this game you'll find that the characters hyper combos are much more powerful than they are on MVC2.  However, since this was the first of these type of fighter games, the characters have less moves to execute.  The thing that really separates this game from all of the others is the Gems.  There are 6 Gems that you may use during battle and different ones have different effects on certain characters.  For example when Juggernaut uses the space gem, he turns silver and gains super armor.  When Psylocke uses the Power gems she creates 3 copies of herself so then it's like fighting 3 of them at once.  The final boss on this game is Thanos.  He's better than the boss on the other Marvel titles because he's actually a challenge.  He automatically starts the match with all 6 gems and he also has 6 different hyper combos he can do with each gem.  Also this game actually has endings for the characters and the music is superior to all of the other titles except for Marvel vs. Street Fighter. I recommend you buy this game if you can find it for a reasonable price.  You won't be disappointed.  It may seem outdated for those who played MVC2 before playing this but it's still enjoyable."

1124,"Don't you remember the times about 7 or so years ago before the vs. games like X-Men Vs. Street Fighter or Marvel Super Heroes Vs. Street Fighter were out, when you were at your local mall's arcade room, and you spent so much time and needed money on this one game everyone was lining up to play, you kept winning and no one could beat you, you had a blast and you ruled the arcade, you used the Amazing Spider-Man, or Good Ol' Stars and Stripes himself, Captain America, and maybe a little Incredible Hulk was throw in just to show off your skills with multiple players, and you used the Infamouse Yellow, Blue, Green, and all other Gems you could get your hands on to build Speed, Strength, Power, Defence and pretty much eveything else with your character! Well I do, and I was so stoked when it came out, and now you can bring those great feelings back with the PSX Version of this classic fighter from Capcom! Gameplay: Almost arcade perfect with minimal slowdowns, barely noticeable, and you can still pull off everything in here that was possible in the arcade version. Sound: Perfect, unmuffled voices that match perfectly to all characters, and music is still here(and still rules)with no remixes(Thank God)! Music plays just like you would hear it in the arcade! Graphics: Great considering the Ram limitations of the PSX(like that was a problem for this game in the 1st place), and they were done with POLYGONS, yes, POLYGONS! Characters: You get a line up of the following characters: 1. Spider-Man (My favorite! ""Maximum Spider!"") 2. Captain America (""Justice Will Prevail"") 3. The Incredible Hulk (What's to say, he's a ""Monster"" hahahahahaha...sorry.) 4. Magneto (He rules and can pull off great combos!) 5. Wolverine (The cheap one) 6. Juggernaut (He's huge and probably deals more damage than anyone!) 7. Iron Man (With the Infamouse ""Proton Cannon!"") 8. Blackheart (A good and Cheep caharacter, but not as much as Wolvie.) 9. Psylocke (One of my favorite X-men, and overall choice over Wolvie, to bad Gambit wasn't included.) 10. Shuma-Gorath (Not used by me, but still deals damage needed to prevail in this game.) Over-All: If I could, a 9.3/10.0, but I can't, so 4 out of 5, the reason being, could have been one point better if it weren't for the PSX limitations, but man, that definetly didn't stop me from getting it AT ALL!

1130,"Forsaken 64 is one of those games that you never heard of and play it anyways and you find it to be an awesome game. The single-player is intense and the multiplayer is crazier than that. The game itself has six-degrees of freedom so you can shoot upside-down, sideways, etc. The single-player has tons of missions and you will not get through it in one setting. I never actually figured out how to save the game, but I will figure it out eventually. The multiplayer you can either play with bots or with your friends. The game supports 4-player multiplayer, even thought sadly I've only played it with only one other person. The multiplayer game is like a deadlier version of hide and seek because the maps are so big. One thing I like about playing it with bots is being able to play it splitscreen so it's like there are 3 other people in the room with you.

1156,"Megaman legends is capcoms answer to bringing Megaman into the 3d realm on the original playstation. However this game is extremly diffrent then any other megaman game out there. In fact it has a lot in common with zelda: ocarina of time and a few rpg elements such as final fantasy while still somewhat feeling like a Megaman game. Coming from the NES and SNES Megamans I never thought I would ever compare zelda and megaman together but surprisingly it works well. Its not the greatest  game or even the greatest megaman game ever but it is really fun in its own way. Most people do not like the graphics in this game but i think there done really well. The only problem graghicly is due to the early psx hardware most 3d games looked blocky and pixely at the time and this on tries to smooth things out kinda cel shadish but not quite this leads to some blockeness but its still better then most 1998 and before graphics. Kinda a 3d playable anime style to it. The sound isn't to bad in this game. Voice acting can be really good or painfully bad andThe music is catchy maybe not as much as the nes megamans but still good. However there is moments without any music. Technically speaking I would say the game has aged well. The thing I find most memorable about this game is the gameplay. Like I mentioned earlier this game takes megaman into zelda like enviorments with a few rpgs elements. There is a open world which was decent in size for its time, which the game takes place in a small town. There are dungeons to explore which you do so in order to find upgrades to your equipment. Speaking of which you can purchase and find diffrent armor and weopens with diffrent specs (attack, fire rate, etc) in a rpg like menu. With that being said it still manages to feel like a megaman game. There is plenty of missions of which you are running and gunning while jumping on platforms. The bosses while set up like zelda can be taken down easier by weopens you find around in dungeons. As for the story it isn't to bad. It is a little childish but its still pretty good. The characters while the voice acting can be off at times can be good are very memorable. Tron Bonne makes her debut here as a villian who became popular enough to get her own game misadventures of tron bonne and a apperance in marvel vs. capcom 2 and appearing without megaman in the 3rd. There is also a N64 port of this game which isn't as good but if you don't have a psx its still playable plus a sequel.

This game was nothing like that game or any other Megaman games. It was in 3-D and had a story that would blow your mind. I have played through this game around 50 times and no every single part of it by heart. Graphics- 7/10 The transition to 3-D for Megaman isn't an ugly one, but a decent one. Most of the trees have a 2-D look to them and a lot of characters are blocky. Still, you can tell what everything is easily and there is no slowdown at all. Not to mention, there is hardly any load time to wait through in this game. Story- 10/10 You are Megaman Volnutt. Roll Casket and her Grandpa, Barrel Casket, have raised you since they found you when you were a child. Following Barrel's footsteps, Megaman and Roll become Diggers. Diggers are people who search through ruins, infested with Reaverbots, to find parts and other things. The main thing a lot of Diggers are looking for are Refractors, which are extremely powerful crystal-like objects that power society. The world is almost entirely ocean so people must use flying machines or boats to get around. Megaman, Roll, and Barrel crash-land their flying ship, The Flutter, on an island called Kattelox. You go on to discover the island's many secrets and fight off the treasure hungry pirates. Sound- 7/10 The music and sound effects in this game are decent. Nothing will blow your mind away but nothing will annoy you to death. Some tunes even become catchy, like the Apple Market tune. Gameplay- 10/10 You play as Megaman: exploring ruins, fighting pirates, and just helping people out. There are a lot of side quests you can do. You can join a secret gang, fill a museum with underground arts, help a little girl recover, play in game shows, and so much more. The main storyline has you exploring the Sub-Gate ruins in hopes to learn more about the Island's great treasure, or disaster. While in Sub-Gates you can find all kinds of items to do things with. It's not just in the Sub-Gates either; you can search in other digging sites for parts. You have a primary weapon called a Buster Gun, which can be upgraded with 2 buster parts initially. These buster parts can be bought or found and change different aspects of your Buster Gun's shooting. You have a secondary special weapon that can be equipped and upgraded as well. You will get many different special weapons in the game and one of the most fun parts of the game is upgraded your weapons to perfect ability. Difficulty- 4/10 (Note- This is how much I like the difficulty) Since this game is more story based, the difficulty is slight. There is hardly a time where you feel that you are going to die, minus a few bosses. Once you beat the original game, you can go back and play it on a new Hard Mode option. The game is still not that much more difficult but some of the bosses will give you more trouble. Also, to top it off, the game isn't that long. Even the player who likes to talk to every single person and gets lost often can still beat this game in less then 15 hours. That includes the main storyline and all side quests, minus special weapon upgrading. I can now beat the game on Hard Mode in around 5 hours. Overall- 10/10 Despite the game being easy and not having the best graphics or sound, it's still 5 stars. The game's storyline and gameplay is so good that the rest doesn't even matter. You'll still find yourself going back and playing this game over and over again.",1,"Megaman Legends This is my undisputed favorite game of all time.

This game was nothing like that game or any other Megaman games. It was in 3-D and had a story that would blow your mind. I have played through this game around 50 times and no every single part of it by heart. Graphics- 7/10 The transition to 3-D for Megaman isn't an ugly one, but a decent one. Most of the trees have a 2-D look to them and a lot of characters are blocky. Still, you can tell what everything is easily and there is no slowdown at all. Not to mention, there is hardly any load time to wait through in this game. Story- 10/10 You are Megaman Volnutt. Roll Casket and her Grandpa, Barrel Casket, have raised you since they found you when you were a child. Following Barrel's footsteps, Megaman and Roll become Diggers.

It's not just about the rhymes Em is spitting on each track, it's about the hook in the music.

On a personal note, this album was and still is one of my favorites of all time.  I spent considerable time in high school and college playing the album from start to end.

1188,"Finally, after YEARS of seeing Mega Man in 2D shooter side-scroller gameplay, Capcom began to realize the video game scene was changing, and realism was becoming more important than ever.  So in 1997 Capcom decided to take the classic gameplay of the old Mega Man games and bring Mega Man to an ENTIRE new 3D world.  I finally got to experience the 3D Mega Man adventure a few days ago, in July 2006.  So it took me NINE years to finally play it!  What can I say?  I'm slow! I have a few problems with certain parts of the game but overall, I'm happy to report that the jump to 3D was a good one (not to mention a NECESSARY one!)  Mega Man spends the entire time in Legends jumping and shooting through a unique 3D environment. I'm surprised so many people hate the graphics in the game.  They're quite wonderful if you ask me.  Sure, the graphics may be dated because the game is nearly 10 years old (and walking around in Mega Man Legends is sort of like walking around in a giant land of legos) but none of that should matter because you have to take into account the amount of FUN a game provides.  Mega Man Legends provides a LOT of fun. I really loved one of the very first boss fights in the game where I had to keep running and hiding behind buildings because these giant walking blue, red and yellow machines were throwing bombs and shooting laser beams at me.  The first time I completed this battle it took a good 30 minutes ONLY for a bigger, badder machine to come in and defeat me in seconds.  At first I was angry because the game wouldn't let me SAVE before fighting this fourth boss.  ""A half hour of work flushed down the toilet"" was the thought that went through my head. That led me to think the game might be too hard for me to handle, but it turned out I just didn't have the right upgrades for my X-buster equipped (actually I didn't have ANYTHING equipped!) so when I went back to do the battle again I defeated him (her, actually) rather easily. Most of the enemies throughout the game are rather easy to defeat (including the boss fights).  Many of the boss fights will keep you on your toes, though.  The strategy to defeating many of them is to KEEP RUNNING and only turn around when the moment is right and BLAST them!  The only boss who isn't easy is the very last boss (who sounds like Michael Jackson) because he has TWO forms.  The first form you can figure out with practice, but on the second form he turns into a giant machine and THEN the challenge increases.  But it's possible to find enough money to carry up to 10 Sub-tanks to help you out DRASTICALLY.  If you were to carry 10 Sub-tanks he would be a VERY easy boss!  Despite that, the game provides a nice challenge because the way the story unfolds forces you to do a LOT of things.  You have to go HERE, you have to go THERE!  You have to collect THIS, you have to collect THAT!  You'll find out just how many items and weapons are in the game when you hit the Start button and see everything in your inventory.  It's borderline INSANE. You see, to help make the game easier, what you have to do is go around searching for things (things located in treasure chests or holes in walls) and then you have to bring the things you collect back to this yellow vehicle where your female friend (or sister, I forget who she is) will be inside.  She can find ways to turn many of the things you collect into important weapons for you to use.  She must be smart! I think I explained myself correctly, there.  It's kind of confusing because there's so many things you have to collect and that's the main reason I can't give the game a perfect 5-star rating.  TOO MUCH!  In Mega Man Legends you will find SO many weapons and SO many upgrades that it can easily confuse someone (like me) who's normally not exposed to this much activity in a video game. You have to find a little dancing monkey to save your game.  When you're lost, he can also help you by telling you where to go, unfortunately many times he doesn't provide enough information.  So you can be left wandering around for hours until you finally have no choice but to find a strategy guide on the internet to help you out. The music in the game is nice.  It's usually played quietly which is odd because most Mega Man music is RIGHT in your face.  If you can actually hear the music, it's pretty much what you'd expect from a Mega Man game. Listen to those sound effects!!  Sound familiar?  Think South Park!  One of the children (or ""pirates"") sounds JUST like Butters, and a newswoman who appears later in the game sounds like Kyle's mom!  Some of the animation looks like South Park, too.  When did South Park come out?  1997?  Hmmm, makes you wonder... Once again, the graphics.  They aren't as bad as I thought they'd be.  Sort of blocky, of course (since this IS Playstation ONE we're talking about here) but I can't bring myself to really hate the graphics because there's a certain mysterious charm about them.  Mega Man Legends LOOKS like a children's game but it's not, really.  Most children wouldn't be able to complete the game because some boss strategies require careful timing and it would be difficult for a child. The play control... goodness.  It's definitely not easy to figure out at first.  To make Mega Man walk straight, you have to hold down the L and R buttons (this rotates the direction Mega Man is facing) while at the same time you have to use the up, down, left and right buttons to make Mega Man walk forward.  So, because you have to do a lot of running in Mega Man Legends, when an enemy is chasing you and RIGHT behind you, you have to turn around, use the L and R buttons to face him, and THEN hit him.  In the middle of hitting the L and R buttons will probably be the time you take the most hits.  It may take a few hours to properly pull off but you *should* become better at it with practice. A trick to help you: when an enemy is chasing you, run as far away from him as possible and THEN turn around.  Usually the enemy will be far enough away that you will have time to control Mega Man so he's facing the enemy directly.  Then, simply wait for the enemy to get close and fire away!  I wouldn't blame you if you couldn't figure out the controls- it's not the greatest way to control a character.  I'm not sure if Capcom improved the play control in Mega Man Legends 2. I find it funny and insulting that when you find a hole in a wall, many times a *very* small amount of money will be located there.  Small enough to not be able to afford ANYTHING.  It's funny because Capcom made it like ""wow, you found money!"" only to insult you with sofa cushion money.  To find a LOT of money you have to run around shooting enemies. Just running around shooting enemies and collecting zenny (money) is a lot of fun, not to mention addicting.

1191,"To me, Mega Man Legends is one of those games you'll remember years after playing it. The game itself doesn't break any new ground and has its share of flaws, but the overall experience is definitely rewarding. Mega Man Legends pretty much plays like the earlier Tomb Raider games control wise. Unfortunately, there are a few problems with the control scheme, such as a lock on system that doesn't allow you to move while locked on an enemy (which was fixed in MML2), and the fact you also must contend with moving the camera manually in order to compensate for the lack of a better lock on system to hit your mark. Legends also uses a pretty similar graphic engine as Tomb Raider as well, complete with all the flat, 2D scenery that rotates with the camera and all the pixilated surfaces and clipping problems that accompanied that era of Playstation gaming. Unlike Tomb Raider, the environments in Mega Man Legends are much brighter and colorful, adding to the games cartoon-like feel, rather than the dark, dank death-trap ridden tombs that Lara Croft raids. The pretty low difficulty level of the game is also an important factor to look at as well. Considering this game is somewhat geared towards an younger audience, this isn't an error so to speak, but older, more experienced players will fly through the game in a handful of hours (especially considering most of the game bosses can be defeated by constantly circling around them and firing). Thankfully, Capcom added an unlockable difficulty setting to make the game harder for those looking for an additional challenge (oh and is it ever a challenge). Add to this Capcom increased the difficulty on Mega Man Legends 2 a few notches, and all can be forgiven here. So with all these problems, why is Legends such a good game? Heart, and lots of it. Mix in a good story, a wonderful cast of characters (and enemies), and throw in some of Capcom's more respectable forays in voice acting department, and you got a winner. While some may claim that Legends carries a ""kiddy tone"", I actually find this to be one of the game's charms and strengths. Honestly, if you don't laugh when one of the Lego Men, err, I mean Servebots messes up and angers Tron, there is something wrong. Seriously, it isn't anymore kiddy than a Mario or Zelda game (or most of Nintendo's gaming library for that matter). The other thing that makes the Legends series so great is the fact Capcom decided to quit while they were ahead. While I myself still wish they would churn out a Mega Man Legends 3 (considering some of the unresolved issues in Mega Man Legends 2's ending), at least Capcom didn't make a zillion sequels and drain the series of all it's fun and respectability, of which they have done a fine job of doing to the original series and X series. In the end, Mega Man Legends is not a game you'll remember for amazing graphics, razor-sharp control, or challenging quests.

1192,"While `Recovery' may be his comeback (and it's quite a comeback), `The Eminem Show' is clearly the last `great' album Eminem dropped.  From thought provoking yet playful lyrics to slick beats that lace his determined delivery, this album has rarely a dull moment.  Sure, it contains one of his single worst songs (`Drips'), but it also contains a slew of his best. The album opens with a string of strength, starting with `White America'.  The song is targeted at, but not limited to, the political embarrassments that surrounded our country around the time the album was dropped.  With a fiery delivery that shows true passion for his themes, Eminem defies the stigma that surrounds the genre and shows that he has logical teeth behind his words (he's shown that before, but it's always nice to be reminded).  `Business' follows with a funky beat that gives Eminem a nice backdrop for his clownish lyrics.  It's not the best track on the album, and it's certainly not the best of Eminem's playful tracks, but it kind of gets everything right.  `Cleanin' Out My Closet' brings us back to a more serious place, delivering one of Eminem's best tracks to date.  Eminem takes us back to his childhood and uncovers more about his turbulent relationship with his mother.  The picture he paints is grim, yet it is lathered with pure style.  `Square Dance' jumps back to a more playful tone (yet it certainly retains a more serious edge with its lyrical content) and it does so flawlessly.  This one has always been one of my favorites on the album.  The beat is sick and the rhymes are tightly structured around the infectious beat. And then you have `Soldier', which is like one of the best rap songs of the decade.  The track is perfect, containing one of the best beats on the album and the way Eminem struts his swagger, slinging verbal assaults like it was dirt in your eye; it just all screams authentic angst which helps sell this as one of the more poignant tracks on the album.  The anger here is perfectly situated to elevate the track into something so dark it feels raw and real.  Unlike the times when Eminem tries to make his murderistic (yes I made that word up for this review) rampages seem playful or humorous, Eminem shrugs humor to the side and delivers something unlike him yet completely comfortable. He's far more than just a one-trick pony. Reminiscent of his previous releases, there is that one track that became his first single and gathered him boatloads of attention once again; this time it was `Without Me'.  The track is hilarious and fun and certainly in line with `The Real Slim Shady' and `My Name Is'.  I actually prefer `Superman', which is a hilarious parody of all those ridiculously perverse love songs that circulate the airwaves. The later half of the album contains a few tracks that really deserve to be singled out.  `Sing for the Moment' is one of Eminem's better tracks to use samples.  The Aerosmith sampling is perfectly suited for the song and it elevates Eminem's message.  `When the Music Stops' is insanely fierce from start to finish.  `Till I Collapse' is also very strong, and Nate Dogg's chorus lines give the song an almost vintage feel.  I love his voice and the way he lends a touch of class to every track he inhabits.  `My Dad's Gone Crazy' is a great way to close out the album.  Having Hallie on the track seems a tad odd, especially when you consider the things he says in this song, but it's a playful song that is slathered with humor, so don't take this track too seriously. It's just fun. `Say Goodbye to Hollywood' and `Hallie's Song' have their moments, but they don't quite get it completely.  Still, they are nice additions and don't feel like filler here.  In fact, the only track I didn't really care for (outside of the abomination that was `Drips') was `Say What U Say', Eminem's collaboration with Dr. Dre.  It just lacks the real spark that comes from Shady's music.  It felt like a rejected Dre track, not a refurbished Eminem track. Alas, the album as a whole is close to genius.  He proves here that despite his vulgar use of words deemed inappropriate, he cannot be defined by his controversial take on life.  By toning himself down here, Eminem shows us that there is a great deal of talent behind those offensive slurs, developing an album reflective of where he was in his rise to fame.  I love that he is back in the game, and I can't wait to see where he goes now.  If he can top this album then we'll be looking at one of the greatest rappers to ever set foot in the game, but then again, I think he's already achieved that title.",1,"While `Recovery' may be his comeback (and it's quite a comeback), `The Eminem Show' is clearly the last `great' album Eminem dropped.  From thought provoking yet playful lyrics to slick beats that lace his determined delivery, this album has rarely a dull moment.  Sure, it contains one of his single worst songs (`Drips'), but it also contains a slew of his best. The album opens with a string of strength, starting with `White America'.  The song is targeted at, but not limited to, the political embarrassments that surrounded our country around the time the album was dropped.  With a fiery delivery that shows true passion for his themes, Eminem defies the stigma that surrounds the genre and shows that he has logical teeth behind his words (he's shown that before, but it's always nice to be reminded).  `Business' follows with a funky beat that gives Eminem a nice backdrop for his clownish lyrics.  It's not the best track on the album, and it's certainly not the best of Eminem's playful tracks, but it kind of gets everything right.  `Cleanin' Out My Closet' brings us back to a more serious place, delivering one of Eminem's best tracks to date.  Eminem takes us back to his childhood and uncovers more about his turbulent relationship with his mother.  The picture he paints is grim, yet it is lathered with pure style.  `Square Dance' jumps back to a more playful tone (yet it certainly retains a more serious edge with its lyrical content) and it does so flawlessly.

1194,"""Things done changed ..."" -- Notorious B.I.G. Some folks might be wondering what's going on with Marshall/Slim at the moment. His absence on the music scene, despite how you might feel about him, is noticeable. His music is singular, even in such a prolific field as Rap is and even with as many people that are on his CD, whether as a performer, a producer or a mixer. Historically, the people that have walked in his shoes never faired very well, whether it was through continued success or respect amongst fans or becoming a sell-out. I don't think Slim has to worry about the last one at all as he's struggled continuously to stay relevant and fresh. The Eminem show may not be the fan favourite, and it may even have a few low moments that fans would rather do without, but this album is like a snapshot of the artists life in full-color, or stereo. It's a very complex and sometimes moving memoir on his life in song. A lot of other recording artists would be so lucky to have been able to achieve something this powerful so early in their career. In fact, unfortunately, most musicians never do. Good 'concept albums' are few and far between. The story of a young man trying to get up out of the hood, is one that's familiar with a lot of people. The struggle is real and that's probably why his music has resonated with so many folks from all corners of the world. Rap music may have gone through an epiphanous phase during the mid nineties through to ot-five. Slim coming in during the beginning and making it all the way through to the end without plastic surgery, heavy jail time or an over-dose. He may have made it through some dark times in order to tell us about it all years from now. This is an album that absolutely must be listened to as it encapsulates the last decade very well. ... ...",0,"""Things done changed ..."" -- Notorious B.I.G.

1199,"Whether you love him or hate him, it's hard to deny that Eminem is the best rapper today, and may be the best rapper of all time. His clear diction, rapid fire delivery, innovative beats, and clever lyrics make for very entertaining music. The Eminem Show follows up the Grammy winning Marshall Mathers LP with a bang.  The great thing about this LP is it doesn't fall into the trap of so many artisits, especially rap artists, of basically putting out follow-up LPs that sound the same as their last album.  This is a new, fresh piece of work with the same clever lyrics and controversial, in your face style we've come to expect. Without Me, probably the most popular song on the album (excepting possibly Cleaning Out My Closet which got a lot of airplay for the cleaned-up version), is my favorite.  But all the songs, with a few expeptions, are very entertaining.  This is not a CD for  which I find myself reaching for the skip button after every other song.

And by that I mean that the odd numbered members of the series are forgettable, while the even numbered (save perhaps zero, but zero is the absence of value, right?) are stellar. Ace Combat 6. Awesome. Ace Combat 5. Uneven and over too quick. Ace Combat 4. Perfect. Ace Combat 3. Had half the missions removed for the U.S. release. Ace Combat 1 (Air Combat). Stone Age. And Ace Combat 2... If you're into classic gaming and love the Playstation (and especially if you love air combat games) this is a definite buy. The sheer imagination that was put into this game is wonderful. You have night missions, sea missions, desert missions, high-altitude missions, ravine missions, and oh-so-wonderful city-liberation mission. I've said it before and I'll say it again, there's more to graphics than just how many polygons you have and how detailed your textures are. Graphics, even low-res graphics, can and should be BEAUTIFUL. And beautiful this game is in all its Playstation polygon glory. The lighting, the jets, the far off cityscapes and the clouds in the sky, it's all just beautiful (to me at least). And better yet, unlike other air combat games of the era, everything moves at a rocketing speed. Even when you get close to the ground (where other games look like you're moving in slow motion), the game keeps a great sensation of speed. The controls are uniformly tight, utilizing the analog controls to the full. And you can bank and pitch completely upside down, something that many similar arcade-style games of the time don't allow. The game also features a wonderful cockpit view that brings you into the experience even more. There's also voice chatter as you go, some nice arcade style music, and full voice command briefings (nice). Of course you also hear ""Bingo!"" every time you hit a target and get a comment every time you miss too, but that's just keeping with the arcade feel. The enemy A.I. might not be as good as you can get now, but it's definitely good for when this game came out, and you can still get shot down if you play on hard and don't watch yourself.

1202,"First off, let me say that this cd is awesome. Eminem is THE best rapper out there, with great beats, funny lyrics and terrific production.  The songs are very personal, and my favorites are: White America, Square Dance, Without Me and Hailie's Song. Eminem has had a tough life. So have a lot of people. But what makes him inspirational is that instead of wallowing in victimhood, he worked hard, he didn't give up and he found his voice. I admire this artist for channeling his anger into something creative. Furthermore, even as he criticizes his mother, he says ""I'm sorry, mama, I never meant to hurt you"" -- this to a woman who was too busy fighting her own demons to be a mother to her talented and intelligent son. (Couldn't she PLEASE just tell him that she screwed up and she's sorry?) Another emotion that comes through, over and over, is his love for his daughter. What's not admirable about that? Also, I don't see half-naked women writhing in Eminem videos. I see intelligence and humor, and this is what I really love about Marshall Mathers. He is very very funny, and more power to him for taking his pain and his anger and creating humor and art. It's easy to perpetuate wickedness, tough to end the cycle of bad parenting and violence, but he seems to be trying. While I can't speak for all librarians, as a group we're against censorship, and I believe that you should never let anyone tell you what to think about music -- or literature or politics or how to run your life, for that matter. If you're not afraid to open your mind, then check out this terrific group of songs, actually listen to them, and then make up your own mind about it.

The bonus dvd contains almost an hour of concert performances, a music video, the 8 Mile trailer, a 12-minute animated sketch from The Slim Shady Show and a trailer for an upcoming dvd. If you love rap, this is a no-brainer -- the latest, most mature entry from a very talented performer.  If you are curious about the genre or the artist, you may very well find your new favorite disc.  Finally, if you are one of many who criticize this artist on the grounds of sexism, racism or violence, you should listen to it yourself -- and perhaps let yourself be surprised by an articulate, intelligent young artist -- the Marilyn Manson of hip-hop."

1208,"Ok, everyone, it's about time that people put aside their doubts about Eminem's skills or staying power!  Slim Shady's third album, ""The Eminem Show"" proves once and for all that Mr. Mathers is extremely talented, in addition to being a lightning rod for controversy.  With his debut album in 1999, ""The Slim Shady LP"", it would easy to have written him off as another white rapper being a pretender to the throne of hip-hop greatness.  Even with catchy songs like ""My Name is"" and ""Guilty Conscience"" making loud noise on the Top-40 charts, critics were in a hurry to lump him with other 'Great White Hopes' that flamed out like Vanilla Ice (just a complete joke) and Snow (just never found an audience).  The success of his sophomore album, ""The Marshall Mathers LP"" shocked many and showed he had staying power, but the truth is, Eminem was destined for success from the start.   First, Eminem is a gifted lyricist and free-stylist, which already separates him from the pre-fabricated hip-hop garbage like Ja Rule and such.  Second, he made the crucial decision early on to ally himself with arguably the most respected and skillful name in the hip-hop world, Dr. Dre.  With Dre's expert and ORIGINAL sound backing up Shady's vocals, it was inevitable that he would be successful and that eventually people would come around to realize his talent.   ""The Eminem Show"" continues to show the evolution of that talent.  ""Without Me"" captures the same fast-paced, light-hearted slams at popular culture that ""The Real Slim Shady"" did on his previous album.  In addition to such 'amusing' songs like that and ""White America"", Eminem delves deeper into, and makes some peace with, his sordid past.  ""Cleaning Out My Closet"" goes right to the heart of his pain about his upbringing and his fractured relationship with his mother.  If his lyrics in this song are indeed and accurate depiction of his life growing up, then it's no wonder he's such an angry individual.  Yet, through that anger, he seems to be making peace with himself, even if it means terminating any relationship with his mother.  It's gritty, harsh, but real material.   Eminem is branching out into movies now with a loosely autobiographical ""8 Mile"".  Early reviews there seem positive, too.  It's always fascinating to see what he will produce next.  The controversy he generates grabs people's attention the first time.  The skill and talent that he displays keeps people returning each additional time.",1,"Ok, everyone, it's about time that people put aside their doubts about Eminem's skills or staying power!

1212,"While the game may be outdated and not as fun to play as some of the more recent titles, I can't fault this game because this is where it all started. On its own merit in 1995, it was a smash-box hit and everybody was ahhed by the graphics, 3d environments, and the musical score. Back then, we were used to Super Mario World and Final Fight. This was something completely different. No one cared about the flaws the game had back then. It was par for the course. Now, in 2012, a whole 17 years later (really? that long ago...), a person can easily recognize the flaws of gameplay, sound, and playability. Sound effects are lo-fi, almost like comparing a cassette to a CD. The soundtrack is still amazing though, as if it were mapped on an entirely different bit format. Playability, there is one overall mode - the 1P Arcade mode (unless you count options and 2P). Every successful completion of the game with a character unlocks a new character to choose - the same one you fight in round 8. After that, you have all of the characters and there's not much else to do. There's no team battle, no survival, just...1P Arcade. So it works for 1995. The ending movies are pretty bad, all having the same soundtrack and really blocky ugly CGI. Of course in retrospect, this WAS 1995. The movies never got better in the series until much later, but they did improve some. Overall, Tekken deserves a place in your PSX collection, right next to 2 and 3. You won't play it often because Tekken 2 covers all of those bases and more.

1213,"Marshall Mathers is the first pop-music genius of the 21st century.  Ever since ""The Slim Shady LP"", this exhibitionist with a heart of gold has been carving out his own artistic territory - a kaleidoscopic synthesis of music, poetry, suffering, bad potty training, bad relationships, and above all, theater.  In the context of the stage show - look at the cover:  MM on stage in front of a closed curtain; now you see him, now you don't - this album is an a report from the field, so to speak, of the evolving Slim Shady/Marshall Mathers/Eminem personna, which is, after all, the slippery subject of all the art (is it enough to call it music?). So if you're new, don't start here. ""The Eminem Show"" is a public pause, an opportunity the artist has taken to contemplate, confess, and comment on life-to-date.  One of the things that makes this line so compelling is that he is one very, very smart boy, and so his confessions and comments are very, very interesting. His intelligence allows him create, within the context of performance, the illusion of intimacy.  By ""illusion,"" I don't mean he's dishonest.  On the contrary.  Masks make shy people bold. I believe him, whether it's about his industry, his mother, his lawsuits, or how crazy he is about his daughter.  But this is, as the title tells us, a show. The reason it works is that it is so clearly the product of an open heart. One of the other most noteworthy things about the album is that it is more musically ambitious than the first two.  The tracks are still lyric-driven, but MM seems to be honing his own musical voice, and that means that his music is becoming distinguishable from the cookie-cutter gansta rap that has been, for him, merely a diving board.  This seems consistent with his first two albums, each of which was an innovation from everything that had come before it - whether in ""rap"" ""pop"" or whatever.",1,"Marshall Mathers is the first pop-music genius of the 21st century.

Maybe Eminem is on his way to becoming one of the ones who will last, and maybe his songs will be good enough to be covered by later artists.

Dre collaborations are definitely not overused, and Slim's crew offer support in a variety of great ways. ""White America"" made me smile right off the bat, the ""I go to TRL, look how many hugs I get!"" line is hilarious.  ""Cleaning Out My Closet"" is indeed brutal and unwincing, and the rhymes definitely testify to his skill.  I think it made me hate his mother almost as much as he does.  ""Square Dance"" should made anyone young paying close attention feel at least a little uneasy about being drafted.  ""Without Me"" is catch as heck, and seems like a fun live track as well, as shown at Eminem's performance on SNL recently.  It goes on and on.  Perhaps the only song I'm not so fond of is ""Sing for the Moment,"" which features some not-so-great sampling which seems more appropriate for a Puff Daddy track.  Eninem's best when it's his own rhymes and beats filling up the song. Another thing I must mention is that this makes me more interested in seeing 8Mile, the upcoming movie Shady is doing.

Back then in junior school everyone was in conversation about all the characters and the secret ones and how you unlocked them. And know that games like tekken2, tekken3 and soulbade coming to the playstation tekken was suddenly never an issue. All I know is that tekken was a fantastic game at launch and had also beaten virtua fighter on the saturn which was a rival to tekken. If tekken had never come out then I believe with a 100% that none of the existing games that I have mentioned above and their sequals would have been in existance.

The grahics were absolutly incredible and the gameplay was out of this world. This was all in 1995. Now that tekken2 and tekken3 had arrived on the scene it seemed as though tekken had faded to a fairyland. Back then in junior school everyone was in conversation about all the characters and the secret ones and how you unlocked them. And know that games like tekken2, tekken3 and soulbade coming to the playstation tekken was suddenly never an issue. All I know is that tekken was a fantastic game at launch and had also beaten virtua fighter on the saturn which was a rival to tekken. If tekken had never come out then I believe with a 100% that none of the existing games that I have mentioned above and their sequals would have been in existance.

The CD has, for a good surprise, and his first time, the lyrics, printed in the cd booklet. The Eminem Show is Marshall at his darker side. Eminem blasts several people, from President Bush, to Moby. Even Elvis doesn't go unnoticed. ofcourse, that's the fun of having a new Eminem Cd, is to see who, and how many people get slammed. He delves into his relationship with his mom, ouch, and Kim, and his daughter, and Dr. Dre. One of the highlights of the album is a song called Square Dance. It's a very poignant view point of America, and of Eminem's feelings about his own life. Of course, the all the songs have his rhymes, and his rapping. I didn't notice any song that's, well, catchy like ""I Am"". But, why does a song need to be catchy? Maybe that's not how Eminem is feeling right now.",0,"Eminem has done it again.

1232,"After defeating Xenogears, I was looking for a game that was fun to play, and didn't require me to do much thinking. Xenogears was a monster game that had a fantastic, yet confusing plot that really made you think. Breath of Fire 3 is a complete change of pace. Instead of going for an engrossing and confusing plot like FF7 and Xenogears, Breath of Fire 3 continues a simple, but fun plot that feels refreshing to play after finishing a monster game like Xenogears. Breath of Fire 3 doesn't have an overly confusing story. Once long ago, there was a clan on earth known as the dragon clan. After gaining enough power to destroy the world, the dragon clan suddenly disappeared. You play as Ryu, a young boy who suffers from amnesia. He soon befriends two thieves named Rei and Teepo. After he gets into trouble with the authorities, he soon finds out he is an ancestor of the dragon clan. So he embarks on a journey to uncover his mysterious past. Sound original? Sorry, but if it's originality that you want, you won't find it here. Even the battle system is painfully unoriginal. As you play it, it will feel like you have played something else exactly like it. The story, the battle system, everything feels like it was used many times before, and i hate to say this, but the ending is very disappointing. However, with all gripes aside, Breath of Fire 3 is a fun and engaging quest. My favorite part of the game was the characters; they are interesting, and very funny. I also liked that the plot never once got confusing. Even though it was unoriginal, it never got off target and it even sometimes kept you on the edge of your seat. With all the complaints aside, Breath of Fire 3 is fun game to play through. After playing through a monster game like Xenogears, it is refreshing to play. Unfortunately, don't get too excited about the ending.",0,"After defeating Xenogears, I was looking for a game that was fun to play, and didn't require me to do much thinking.

Now  I still play SNES, playing such good games as Super Godzilla, Breath of  Fire I, and the Final Fantasy series. The storyline goes as follows--Ryu is  a survivor of an ancient race of dragons, the Brood, which nearly destroyed  the world. However, he is a good dragon. He allies himself with Yraall  Region thieves, Rei and fellow dragon Teepo, who at the time doesn't know  he's a dragon. He aligns himself with the young Princess of Wyndia,  Princess Nina, and the daughter of a smart scientist, Momo, a mutated  vegetable named Peco who has a lot of significance at the end of the game,  and a Guardian of Urkan Tapa who's race once fought and defeated the  dragons in a war, Garr. Together they quest to find Ryu's origin and other  members of his race, and to find out if Ryu is evil or not. With beautiful  music, surroundings, and a great storyline, this is one of the best RPGs of  all--with many mini-games abound and a fantastic battle system.

1239,"Breath of Fire Three is the third part to what was a very good series of RPGs. Breath of Fire One seems to be what most people I talk to about games  consider the best. Even though I loved Breath of Fire 2 the most. I  expected a lot from breath of fire 3. Perhaps this helped lower my opinion  of Breath of fire 3, but I did not like this game. As far as game play  goes like all BoF games in BoF 3 you have the ability to turn into a  dragon. Like BoF 1 and unlike BoF2 when you turn into a dragon you stay one  for a while. While you're a dragon you loose MP every turn to keep you from  staying one forever in that combat unlike BoF 1. All the character seem to  get their own special power. The character list is short and one of the  characters on the list of the book never fights with you as a character.  The training system you can find people to help you with is actually kind  of pointless weird and honestly I didn't like it. The town to town walking  is slow and you never get fast transportation. As far as plot goes the  plot is the plot starts off okay. Then about two hours in goes in a  different direction. It is fine for a while then but around the end is a  large dungeon that is boring to go threw and leaves the any not very much  of a climax. They lost any suspense you could have built up similar to the  Tales Of Destiny ending. Also the characters don't have very strong and  noticeable personalities. Also if you keep up with it you won't like the  direction the plot takes thirds of the way threw. As far as control goes  it's basically standard of with noting exceptionally notable about  it. The graphics to this game are not very good. It is done in sprites.  Sometimes I myself prefer sprits but I do not like the character drawings  of this game. On the walking town to town map character looks chubby and  short. The drawings are basic and too simple. There was only one of the  dragons I liked the look of. However there is a little onion that can  follow around with your party who beat all other RPGs in cuteness of a  single character. The cute hopping onion is defiantly the main reason to  buy this game if you do. And finally as far as length of time it can stay  interesting the game is longer them many RPGs won't be beaten on a short  rental. If you get this game buy it. Overall this game is the worst of  the BoF series.

1263,"Breath of Fire III arrives almost three years after the fun-but strictly orthodox-Super NES title, Breath of Fire II. Although BOFIII isn't a radical departure from the earlier games in the series, don't let that turn you off; it's reassuring to see that sprite graphics haven't given way entirely to origami-style polygons. Sporting a quasi-medieval European setting, a heroic story line, and turn-based battles, BOFIII will appeal to fans of Square's Final Fantasy series and Working Designs' Lunar titles. An Epic Journey Breath of Fire III starts with the discovery of a tiny dragon that goes on a deadly rampage before it's captured. The dragon escapes and is transformed into a young boy named Ryu, who is befriended by a pair of delinquents, whose thoughtless pranks get them captured by some truly evil people. Ryu is left for dead, but his dragon powers revive him, so he sets off in pursuit of his friends' captors, unaware that he's about to be drawn into an ever-deepening pool of danger, deceit, and death. Like earlier BOF titles, Ryu can befriend several partners during his epic journey. Nina, the princess of Windia, makes another appearance in the series, although in this game she's apparently unrelated to her earlier incarnations. Ryu, too, shares the name of a character from the series, but he's also unrelated. However, Gobi, from the first BOF game, makes a cameo appearance. Nostalgic Graphics Graphically, BOFIII is leaps and bounds ahead of its predecessors. Texture-mapped polygons are used to create the backgrounds, terrain, and buildings, while sprites are used to compose the various characters. More animation, colors, and special effects have been added to this version, but the look of the game will still be familiar to fans of the BOF games. The three-quarter-overhead view field map can be rotated somewhat so you can peek behind obstacles, but not to any great extent. Battles are fought directly on the field map, with characters and monsters displayed diagonally in one of four directions: Two are seen from the front and two from the rear. Solid Craftsmanship The battle system is turn-based, with some consideration given to quickness: Characters move in sequence to their speed parameter. For example, in some battles you may want to use light armor so that your character moves quicker instead of heavy armor which can slow you down. Also, certain characters have speed parameters higher than their enemies and may get extra turns while fighting. Beyond the usual manual, magic, and item attacks, characters can transform into dragons. Initially, only Ryu has the power to transform (and only when he's far into the game), but the other characters gain that power later. Transformation, though, requires crystals called Dragon Genes and AP (magic points) for the Genes chosen. By combining up to three Genes, different dragons can be created; the more Genes you use, the more powerful your dragon, though you'll use more AP. AP is also consumed at a constant pace while the dragon is in battle. Finally, you can learn monster skills for special attacks and spells. The construction of Breath Of Fire III's battle system-and of the whole game, for that matter-is very polished-thanks to excellent controls. You won't be moaning about the way this game handles. Sound Bites However, all isn't well in BOFIII. The sound effects are fine, if not particularly inspired. In battle, the characters emit rudimentary shouts, screams, and spell names, but not much more. And even though the sounds can get annoying, they're not anywhere near as badly done as the soundtrack. The music veers widely from unmemorable electronica to hopeless schmaltz, and more often than not, it doesn't add to the atmosphere of the story. The music seems more appropriate for a corporate infomercial than a heroic fantasy RPG. Aside from the inexplicably bad soundtrack, BOFIII is worth a long look from RPG fans. Although it doesn't possess the visual and aural magnificence of Final Fantasy VII (which few games will ever accomplish), Breath of Fire III holds up as a very enjoyable RPG in which sure craftsmanship is easily evident.",1,"Breath of Fire III arrives almost three years after the fun-but strictly orthodox-Super NES title, Breath of Fire II.

1268,"Breath of Fire III is one of those games that can induce a trance of nostalgia upon thought.  I can say this about few games because most are powered by processors that reflect obsession with graphics and innovation.  Innovation is necessary, and appreciated, but games like BOF3 need never disappear.  It caters to the old-time gamer in all RPG veterens, delivering a simplistic save the world storyline and involving gameplay.  And what gameplay!  It's simplicity and charm will, hopefully, impress those who give it a chance because it is very deserving of credit.  Last, I must mention the fishing system.  It's incredibly addictive, simple, and enjoyable.  Nothing else could more easily describe it.  Throw in about another hundred fish and a wider variety of rods and bait, and you'd have a full game that I would have to own!  It's that good.  For everyone: whether an RPG-newbie or a hardcore veteren, you should give this game a chance.

To clarify, it is not as good as an FF game, but it is nonetheless enjoyable and fun. The story is pretty linear, the characters are well developed, and part III offers much of the same fun that was the original BOF for the SNES (which was produced by Squaresoft, not Capcom). The only drawback is the clunky controls, which can be frustrating when you are trying to move down stairs or bend around tight corners.

A big thumbs up going to the fact that you don't have to change screens to get into a battle (like Chrono Trigger).  This saves lots of time and makes thing more dramatic!  Fighting in narrow hallways and thick forests was great! I'm not going to spoil it for anyone...but the ending sucked badly.

1286,"Breath Of Fire 3 is a traditional RPG with a combination of 3D and 2D graphics.  The characters are what one would expect from a BOF game. The battle layout is well done for the most part, even though the loading time for some commands is just horrible.  The Masters system is a cool idea, as you can shape your characters into any class you want by apprenticing them to the right master.  The feature that keeps BOF 3 from reaching classic status is the story.  It starts out interesting, but about halfway through the game it seems to lose it's purpose.  Another annoying aspect is the desert area near the end of the game. The directions they give you are vague and confusing.  Worst of all however, is after all the long hours you put into playing the game, the ending is short and stale. If you are a seasoned RPG fan and have played through all of the other RPGs for Playstation, BOF 3 will keep you busy until the next big hit arrives.

1293,"Sure, my kid loves it. But I can see why they have published multiple abridged versions. The original text is awkward and wordy. The story structure is also all wrong. There are three antagonist engines before the hero is introduced when two would do the job. Each time and engine stops they repeat the same wordy sentence. And only at the last ""bad"" engine do they introduce the gimmick of the book which everyone remembers -- where engines puff their thoughts in short little sentences. It would make a lot more sense if all the engines talked like the hero in short puffs. The layout is also questionable. Long sentences break up between pages awkwardly and are hard to get out in a single breath. Lastly, the hero's part and the Act III conclusion are way too short. It should have taken up a greater page count -- or maybe lose the tedious setup.",0,"Sure, my kid loves it. But I can see why they have published multiple abridged versions.

1315,"I remember Tekken 2 being one of my first fighting games I have ever played, and one that I kept coming back to. It wasn't just the nostalgia that kept me coming back, but the overall gameplay as well. Almost everything about this game was done right, and there is very little to complain about. Tekken 2 takes place 2 years after the events of the first Tekken. The plot isn't very well developed and isn't really involving, but everything else more than makes up for it. The graphics (for the time) were amazing and the animations were also nicely done. The roster includes 24 characters who are all unique and feel very well balanced. The game is very accessible and almost anyone can pick up this game and get a pretty decent grasp on it. The controls are simple and intuitive, and I always believed that this control scheme (each button controls a limb-ex. left punch, right punch) is one of the best for fighting games. For modes, you have your basic arcade mode which you complete to unlock new characters. You also have a vs. mode, a team battle mode (which is very enjoyable), a survival mode, a time attack mode, and a practice mode. All of these modes offer allot of replayability as it is easy to dump countless hours into any of these modes. The combat system is still excellent to this day. The amount of combos that each character can do is pretty substantial and you will discover new moves without being too overwhelmed. There also aren't really any cheap tactics unlike some of the more recent iterations of tekken (such as excessive juggling). Overall, this game is one of the best fighting games that I have ever played. With plenty of characters to learn, plenty of modes to choose from, amazing looking backgrounds, and a terriffic combat system, there is no reason to skip this game. If you still have a ps1/ps2, BUY THIS GAME.

What made the game so great in arcades was the tag-team feature in which you picked two fighters and could switch at any time during the fight.  This feature made for great fighting fun, but because of the PS1's RAM inabilities, that feature had to be omitted.  It's obvious Capcom released this game to make a quick buck on the X-Men and Street Fighter licenses, and while on it's own it can be a solid fighter without the tag-team feature, the graphics are painfully watered down, the game is loaded with sloppy frame rates, and there is loads of slowdown.  If you can get past all that, this may be worth checking out if your a Street Fighter fan, but the Marvel VS Capcom games that would be released later on next-gen systems are more worth your time.",1,"To say that the PS1 version of Capcom's X-Men VS Street Fighter is butchered is saying it lightly.

1355,"I actually played the Saturn version with the 4MB RAM cart, and I have to say that the PS1 version SUCKS! Why? Because tag-team was taken out because the PS1 could not handle it. It did not have enough RAM (Random Access Memory) to switch fighters since it takes about at least 40 MB of RAM, and the PS1 only has 32 MB.  If Capcom did put in tag-team, then it would take forever to load up a character once you tag-team with it, you can tag-team with the same character, but it does not feel the same.

1358,"When a system is incapable of doing justice to a game, one would think a company would be smart enough to not release the game on that system. But for reasons that are probably based entirely around making money, Capcom has released a completely butchered version of its arcade fighter, X-Men vs. Street Fighter, on the PlayStation. The only thing added to the game is super cancels, which allow you to string multiple super combos together. Super cancels were lifted out of Street Fighter EX without much forethought, so some characters' cancels work better than others. In fact, the entire game seems to have been designed without much forethought. Even if this were a perfect translation of the arcade game, the simple fact remains that X-Men vs. Street Fighter is a terrible, unbalanced, pound-on-buttons-at-random-and-win-anyway fighting game. One of the few things the arcade version (and the Saturn version, which was an arcade-perfect translation) had going for it was the graphics. They weren't spectacular, but the characters were large, colorful, and used a lot of frames of animation. The PlayStation, a fairly weak machine when it comes to 2D, simply can't handle that much data. So Capcom chopped out tons of frames (Juggernaut does a whole lot of standing still, and his attacks are about two frames). The graphics look very washed out, and there is a completely unacceptable amount of slowdown. Ken's Shinryuken super combo had most of the frames chopped out, and it still slows the game down to a crawl. The slowdown and missing frames are so bad and so noticeable that they have a detrimental effect on the already bad gameplay. The arcade version's big selling point was that you picked two characters and could tag-team between the two at any time during the fight. Your teammate would also come out and help in a two-level team attack, as well as in Alpha counter-style attacks. Since duplicating this on the PlayStation would require keeping four entire sets of animations in memory, the tag feature has been completely removed. You still pick a second character (cruelly taunting players expecting the full functionality of the arcade version), but he only makes his presence felt during the team attacks and counters. To make up for the shortened play time, the one-round battles of the arcade have been extended to the standard two-out-of-three format. Characters also slowly regain life, much like your backup character would in the arcade. This game just shouldn't exist. At some point in the development cycle, someone should have stepped in, seen that the PlayStation simply couldn't do justice to the original game, and pulled the plug. It took an additional 4MB of RAM to get the Saturn, which already has more RAM than the PlayStation, to run a perfect version of the game. I like the Street Fighter series as much as the next guy, but this is taking it way too far.",1,"When a system is incapable of doing justice to a game, one would think a company would be smart enough to not release the game on that system.

I like that it's a great diversion from the standard shoot-em up. The problem is with the tedious game play. The game is tough, just from the mental standpoint and it takes some effort to figure out what you're supposed to be doing in each level. But that's part of the fun, figuring things out. Unfortunately, it's moving through the levels and getting from point A to point B that is problematic. There are way too many places where you have to make a pinpoint precision jump or other move with absolutely NO margin for error. In some cases this means you fall somewhere and have to climb back to your starting point, or in some cases you die, meaning you have to start the whole level over again. And after trying one of these jumps over and over and over, you finally get frustrated and give up. There were instances where I tried a jump over and over, and then suddenly made the jump and had no idea what I had done differently from the previous numerous attempts. For any game to be that touchy is just a disgrace. It's too bad, I think I could have liked this game but the tedious pinpoint controller movements ulitmately ruined the game for me.

Even my family and onlookers were startled or to afraid to play this game because of the  realism captured in enormous worlds and creepy CD sounds."

1381,"This game realeased in 1997 (I think), was the first in the Klonoa series (which includles a few more games in Japan), and was defenently a ""sleeper-masterpeice"" for PSone. This game however feels a little bit different than the other games in this series, though I'm not excatly sure why. I think the main reasons it feels so different are: the graphics, the story line, the music, and the character differnces. Graphicaly wise, you can tell it's older, but the graphics have a certain charm to them. The few out-of-engine motion scenes though, are magnificent! However, the graphic style is drasticaly different from it's sequels. The plot is overall, a little more ""classic fantasyish"" and feels kinda like something you might read in a book (which is probably what they were aiming at since it has a ""book theme""). It has a bit of a melancholy feel to it; which makes it feel slightly more intense than it's sequals. Actually, I think it's the best story of any of the Klonoa games. As for the ending, I loved it! Sad and moving without being overly sad. I think it's my favorite vidoe game ending! The BGM is a different style than Lunatea's Veil also, (It's PS2 sequal) less solemn and RPG like, and a little more lively, or something, not really sure what the word is, it fits the game well. What I mean by character differneces is that it has no familiar characters other than Klonoa and Huepow. Klonoa, however, is quite different than in his sequels. Dispite these differences, the gameplay is practicaly clone-copy of the others in the series, esspecial Lunatea's Veil. From what I have heard, many people that played this were dissapointed with the sequel. I think that it was probably because they were used to this style and didn't give it much of a chance (personaly, I was dissapointed with THIS game at first, then started to really like it after I got used to it). Anyway, bottom line is, that if you've played all the other Klonoa games, expect this one to be a little different, but defenently get it, if you enjoyed the others, you'll enjoy this! If you haven't played any of the other games in this great series, it's based on engaging gameplay with simplistic controls. This game is one of the few ""2.5D"" games in existance. It plays parellel to a 2D game (people still hanging onto their old copies of Sonic the Hedgehog 2 or Mario Bros. should try this). In this game, however, you are in a 3D environment (don't worry, the paths are clearly defined, you won't have any trouble figuring out where you can and can't go). You can interact with the background by throwing things into it, this is esspecially key in some bosses, This is the 2.5D part. There are 12 levels (not counting the final boss)in this game, plus an unlockable time attack level. This game is pretty easy, and if your looking for an extreamly hard, nail biting, challenge, this probably isn't for you. This is more of a fun, relaxing game.

1425,"The original Tomb Raider was a landmark game for the Playstation and the start of a very long running series. It holds up well, but is a definite acquired taste. Tomb Raider begins with adventurer and treasure huntress Lara Croft being hired by business woman Jacqueline Natla to search an ancient cavern in Peru for a piece of the Scion, an ancient talisman of great power. However, after finding the piece, Lara is betrayed by Jacqueline's men. Now it's a race across the world to find the remaining pieces of the Scion before Jacqueline attains its mythical power. Tomb Raider is an early Playstation game, and unfortunately the graphics haven't aged very well. Although many set pieces in the game are very impressive all the levels tend to feel very samey. Despite this the game's length is impressive. There are over fifteen massive levels with hidden caches of ammo and first aid packs, giving you a great sense of exploration throughout the game. Lara moves in a very stiff fashion. Her controls are tank-like and You have to hold down a button for her to walk. She takes very long jumps, but running jumps have a delay that requires you to plan your jumps ahead of time in most cases. Fortunately there is a training mission where Lara instructs you on how to play in her home. The game is primarily a puzzle platformer. Each level contains a series of puzzles that will test your problem solving skills. Scattered throughout the many ruins and caves are vicious animals and hired goons all chomping at the bit to impede your progress. This is where combat comes into play. Lara starts off the game with twin pistols that have unlimited ammo. Through out the game you will find a variety of firearms, however these weapons do have limited ammo, but the pistols ensure you will always have a fighting chance in battle. The last gameplay feature to talk about is the process of saving your game. The PC version of the game allowed the player to quicksave wherever they wanted. The console versions of the game on Playstation and Sega Saturn do not have this luxury. You can only save with the use of crystals that are placed along the path you are intended to follow. Unfortunately, once a crystal is used it is gone. This makes it really difficult when you've got a very long stretch ahead of you and not much health. Some areas have multiple crystals forcing you to carefully plan how often you save. This game has many flaws, but it is a very rewarding experience. I would recommend the game for those expecting a challenge. The later games in the Tomb Raider series ironed out many of the issues experienced here. If you're curious about the beginning of the franchise you won't be disappointed, but maybe a little stressed. For classic PC gamers I'd recommend Tomb Raider: Unfinished Business. This is the original game plus two bonus missions with two new levels a piece.",0,"The original Tomb Raider was a landmark game for the Playstation and the start of a very long running series.

1433,"These are great containers. At first, I was very disappointed in how poorly of a fit the lid and container were. But I decided to try them anyway, and proceeded to sanitize them properly. Being a chef for six years has taught me many things. One of which, you should always boil new plastic containers for at least a minute (best at 5 minutes) to remove any contaminants from manufacturing. We get enough plastics and other chemicals in our diets already. And if you are buying for your kid's lunches like I did, you should do this purely for your family's sake. The trick to plastic containers with fitted lids is that after you boil them in plain tap water for at least one minute: 1. Remove from boiling water using a pair of tongs or a slotted spoon. 2. Tip the container/lid so most of the water drains back into the pot. 3. Immediately find it's matching container/lid from the pot, and after draining it as well, put the two pieces together. 4. Allow to cool. 5. The lid and container should now be a much better fit. They might still be snug, but should be much easier on your fingers. Don't take my word for it though. Please only try one at first to make sure it works as well for you as it does for me. I hope this helps everyone purchasing this product.",1,"These are great containers.

1443,"I didn't beat the game so I guess my opinion shouldn't count...but here it is: This game has GREAT historical value. Prince: Sands of Time, Soul Reaver, God of War and many others are based on some things that Tomb Raider made popular. Game would be perfect if save points were better placed. It would be best to have a save game option at any point but those were old times... What I disliked: I beat Mexico levels playing each one two to six hours. I got to St Francis' Folly level. Things started to look really tiresome: first, I spent too much energy beating pillar sub-level and didn't have spare medpack reaching ground floor. I restarted. I got enough energy by reaching ground but wasn't able to beat pool puzzle on top. Then I figured out that I should have gone to the ground WITHOUT USING SAVE CRYSTALS, open all puzzle doors (top level door is connected to ground switch) and then climb back up...which means another level restart. Maybe this game is for hardcore fans, but I am not one of them...I got frustrated enough to quit.",1,"I didn't beat the game so I guess my opinion shouldn't count...but here it is: This game has GREAT historical value.

1446,"I had to go back and play this game after playing (and loving) Tomb Raider Anniversary. Playing Anniversary and then going back to the original really makes you appreciate just how awesome this game was. The level design was just amazing with all the different areas you get to explore. I haven't played the original since it first came out so I didn't realize just how much Crystal Dynamics took from this game. They took a lot. Some of the level designs are almost identical. The biggest difference between the old and the new is the difficulty. Anniversary is way easier. But not because the puzzles or enemies are easier. It's because of the controls. Back in Tomb Raider 1, the controls were pretty terrible. But what do you expect from a game breaking new ground in the world of 3D?

1449,"OH YES....this game is what it's all about.  Sure, it looks totally archaic now with its primitive low-polygon 3D (cf. Lara's Madonna-style pyramid breasts) and jerky low frame rate - BUT WHO CARES.  ""Tomb Raider"" was one of the first fully-realized 3D games, with huge environments and a camera that lets you explore them fully - something next-gen developers still seem to have a problem with sometimes - and, of course, best of all, an action hero that players across the board could instantly connect with.  Yes, Lara Croft - men want her, women want to be her...lol.  Forget about her later misadventures on celluloid and (worst of all) the PS2 platform.  Even on the PS1, all the new innovations in graphics and AI that cropped up in subsequent TR installments couldn't improve upon the originality of gameplay you have here in the debut.  The puzzles, the secrets, the at-times relentless action, this game has it all. Much like Indiana Jones, we first encounter Lara as she explores some ruins in South America - allegedly the village of Vilcabamba, an actual archeological site in Ecuador, although as it appears in the game it's more of a generic hotch-pot of pre-Columbian art and architecture.  Of course you have the rolling ball traps everywhere, and of course she eventually finds a golden idol - more nods to Indy.  Later she explores Las Vegas versions of Rome and Egypt, slaughtering more endangered species in the process than are even left on the planet (PETA just loved this game) before proceeding to - where else? - Atlantis, which is naturally swarming with freakish and bloodthirsty mutants.  All this because she's in search of an artifact whose magical powers, if in the wrong hands, could destroy the world, or something. It's easy to punch holes in the ridiculous plot, but that doesn't affect the entertainment value - again just like with Indy, you know it's stupid, but you're more than willing to suspend disbelief just to go along with the wild ride.  Getting through the levels is not always easy; you'll need to sharpen both your combat and puzzle-solving skills.  There's also a lot of replay value owing to the oftentimes diabolically-hidden ""secrets,"" which usually contain caches of weapons and the infamous ""medi-paks.""

It has classic written all over it. Despite being dated, and encountering countless predecessors, sequels and dissapointing movies the game manages to have to a strong following and is considered to best game of them all. It was orginal back then, where archaeologist Lara Croft, a female Indiana Jones, is called upon to use her intelligence, amazing physical skills, and her big guns to solve complexed and ancient puzzles, battle hard enemies and travel the whole world in style. I forget the storyline, since I haven't played this game in ages, but it's good. You should ask my mom, who played and beat every ""Tomb Raider"" game(Sorry mom). I'm not kidding! She did! The graphics are surprisingly good to look at, as well as the hard puzzles to solve(which made it famous to play) and the fun movie scenes. Check out the dinosaur too in this game. it's a blast!

1455,"If I could have give 6 stars for this game, I would have.  I played this originally when it first came out in 1996.  Back then, games such as Resident Evil and Tomb Raider were ground-breaking milestones in entertainment known as video games.  I won't talk about Resident Evil here because everyone knows about that. Tomb Raider was the first game to give players control of a character in a true 3D environment.  Sure, you had games like Doom and Wolfenstien, but they played only on a single plane with your character spinning on an axis.  Tomb Raider allowed you to control Lara, the feminine version of Indiana Jones, an use the environments such as cliffs, roofs, etc. to progress through the levels.  Level design in Tomb Raider is really what the game is centered around.  Beautiful, stunning, breath-taking, eerie, surreal, all describe the level design here.  Nothing short of ingenious. The game mechanics and control of Lara were never the best, but they were also adequate to get the job done.  Lara spins on a fixed axis when the player turns left and right, and forward makes her run in the direction she is facing.  Turning can sometimes be a chore, especially when the action is turned up a notch.  Luckily, the circle button makes Lara do a somersault tumble, for a quick ""about-face"".  The shimmying and climbing from ledge to ledge and jumping has always been amazing.  Combine that with sliding down angular rock formations and time jumps and grabs to ledges, and you are bound to fall in love with the action that Eidos developed (NOTE: This kind of mechanics shined most for me in this game as opposed to all the predecessors, including Angel of Darkness for PS2.  This kind of action became less and less as the series went on, save for Last Revelation, maybe).  The swimming sequences and puzzles are also a really wonderful treat as well. There are plenty of surprises in this game that I don't want to give away, however, I will tell you that some of the levels in the game will stick in your memory for a long, long time after.  For example, ""The God Room"" of St. Francis' Folly has got to be one of the best and most memorable and beautiful levels of any game that I've played. So why am I writing this review now, 7 years after the release date?  For a few reasons.  First, being that I can't get the game out of my head for more than a few months.  Every six months I go back to it.  The second reason, is that when I bought a PS2, I knew I would be playing the original Tomb Raider again and wanted that backward capability.  And THIRD and quite possibly the most important (and the reason I titled this review ""Dear Eidos"") is that Angel of Darkness was the single reason that I sold my PS2 for an X-Box.  At first I enjoyed AOD, but the game has rampant problems.  I've always welcomed a new Tomb Raider game in my life and gave AOD more than one chance.  I loved all the other PS1 Tomb Raider games, including III, which got a lot of harsh and unwarranted criticisms in my mind, but whatever.  I hated AOD and want Eidos to know that.  And FOURTH reason is that I repurchased the new and compact PSOne last week.  I still own my Tomb Raider from back in the day.  Last night I played it and the magic was back like from the first time I played it.  Sure the graphics feel older, but they are by no means bad at all considering that I play games like Halo, Crimson Skies, Prince of Persia, and Rainbow Six 3 on the X-Box.

1458,"So, this is where it all began - the original Tomb Raider. In November 1996, Britain was changing. With the phenomenal success of the Spice Girls and the phrase ""girl power"", there wasn't a better time to bring out an all-female computer game heroine who kicked [rear]! Enter Lara Croft. The game went straight to No. 1 all over the world and shifted more than 10 million copies to become THE biggest selling PlayStation game of all time. Lara soon became a cultural icon, gracing hundreds of magazine covers the world over - and not just computer magazines, mainstream magazines such as Rolling Stone and Time; undoubtedly the biggest magazine names in the world. Four sequels followed in the form of Tomb Raider II, Tomb Raider III, Tomb Raider IV: The Last Revelation and Tomb Raider IV: Chronicles. The five games have sold a combined total of 40 million worldwide and secured Eidos Interactive and more importantly, Lara Croft and Tomb Raider, a place in video gaming history as undoubtedly the greatest, most popular and enjoyable computer games of all time. The story of Tomb Raider is simple really. Lara Croft is a semi-famous archeologist adventurer and has been hired by a mysterious woman, Natla (last name unknown) to search the globe for an ancient artifact, known as the Scion, that is beleived to have come from the lost city of Atlantis. Lara sets off on her travels to find this artifact but before she can find it, she must search other areas of the world to find clues and hints that will open the way forward to her ultimate prize. Around halfway through the game, while uncovering clues about the artifact in question, Lara also unveils the truth about Natla; a story told through amazing cut-scenes. The storyline is intriguing to say the least and keeps you on the very edge of your seat as you beg to know more, yet never for the game to end. The game begins with simple, pedestrian levels for newcomers to get to grips with the controls. The enemies are only small in the first few levels; bats, dogs etc. that can be eliminated with a single shot of Lara's Pistols - a weapon that she has with her always that features an unlimited amount of ammo. The game has a massive 16 levels that will keep you playing for months - it took me 10 months to complete. In fact, I finished the week Tomb Raider II came out so once I'd finished with the first, I spent the next 10 months playing the second one! This has been a regular oocurance and has resulted in me playing all five Tomb Raider games for around 6 years without a break! I remember the days when I bought this game...I was only 10 and it scared me to death! The enemies may not look very real, but remember that controlling Lara is! You control her every move so her life is in your hands! At the time the game was released, the graphics were unbelievable and the scenery breathtaking. The former is not so much now, but the latter still stands. Graphics in computer games have come a very long way since 1996, but half an hours' play on Tomb Raider with Ms Croft, and its superior excellence shines through. The final levels are set in and around Atlantis, and are classic moments in video gaming history. From the rocky cliffs of Asia, to the hot muggy forests of South America and the haunting and eerie lost island of Atlantis, there's something here for everyone. Buy it now! OVERALL GRADE: 10/10 All in all, Tomb Raider is the ultimate PlayStation game. Everything about this game is so enchanting and memorable. The atmosphere, the sounds the animals make, the noises Lara makes when falling off a rock, the music that cues to tell you something exciting is about to happen - everything! This is a true classic in video gaming history that deserves all the critical praise it recieved 6 years ago. If you haven't got Tomb Raider in your PlayStation games collection, it is not complete. Only when you purchase all 5 Tomb Raider games will your collection be complete. With the soon-to-be released Lara Croft Timb Raider VI: The Angel Of Darkness, all six Tomb Raider will keep me playing for decades, literally.

1464,"From the ruins of Rome to the futuristic setting of Atlantis, Tomb Raider takes the gamer through a variety of wonderful worlds.  Unlike its sequels, it stays in the tombs and out of other settings.  I believe that it is one of the best games ever made, and it certainly is a classic.  However, I believe that its sequels in many aspects overshadow it. The scenery in Tomb Raider is better than most games, although it is mostly cubed and flat.  The game play and plot are wonderful, and the graphics and sounds are acceptable.  However, the artificial intelligence enemies are less than intelligent, and the gamer is often left feeling underestimated with the ease of some of the puzzles.  Laura's moves are limited, and the weapons supply is less than perfect. I would recommend this game to any fan of the Tomb Raider series and to the average gamer.  However, I do feel that other versions have better qualities.  Tomb Raider II offers wonderful AI and is perhaps the best for a gamer seeking combat. Tomb Raider III combines the better aspects of the previous two, and Tomb Raider: The Last Revelation offers the best plot and character mobility.  If you are looking to stay in the tombs, or if you are not into puzzles, stick with this game.

Nowadays, every other game is a 3d adventure ""in the vain of Tomb Raider"". The game is very solid. Well placed and thought provoking puzzles. Some nice action, great graphics which still hold up today, and lots of fun. The only complaint is the lack of a decent ending, and that I have to shoot a fellow human at least 60 times in order to kill him. How untrealistic is that?

1479,"Fighting Force was the wanna-be ""Streets Of Rage"" for PlayStation. If you grew up in the 90's and owned a Sega you'll know what I'm talking about. The game had tons of flaws such as the lo-fidelity sound effects (sssshhhhheeeewwwmmm) and the blocky PC-like design of the characters. Heck, it looked like a Windows 95 platform game. There are four characters to choose from : two chicks, a big giant and the handsome one. They each have their own moves but have serious shortcomings. Smasher can take a lot of damage and deal it too; but he's slow as a mule. Hawk is a decent fighter but is open to a lot of hits. Alana and Mace are both quick (alana moreso) but are weak and fragile. The game was unduly hard due to the overhaul of the game's engine. Back then, games overloaded easily especially if they were not rendered correctly. The load times on this game tell you there's a lot of extra space here. An obvious pitfall is when there are many enemies/items on the screen it evokes slow command response but ONLY from players' controllers (remember trying to grab a guy and your player executes an 'air grab' 1 second after you press the button?). This resulted in getting beat up from 5 or more directions and having a briefcase hurled at your head. Not fun. Items were also a bother as you found that punching a guy mysteriously involved you picking up a crate first. Then you got kicked in the shin and you dropped the crate as two more guys fired shots at you and you're spinning through the air. Fun! Yet when you want to pull a pole off the wall you instead invoke a reverse backhand that misses and makes you look like an idiot. And for that ugly move sir you get a pipe to the face. You eventually either get frustrated with the game or you learn to live with it. The game experience for me is always bitter sweet because even though I've learned to live with the quirks they still get in my way. The game gets progressively harder as you advance through the levels and sometimes you white knuckle your controller to keep from using a continue (which, by the way starts you over on the level...totally bogus!). When you finally DO finish the game it seems underwhelming. You'll see what I mean when you finish it. All in all, despite its obvious and frustrating flaws, the game is still a classic.

You get your pick from four forgettable crime fighters: pixie-pig-tailed Alana, gruff Hawk, leather-pants-wearing ""Look at me, I'm Nabiki Tendo"" Mace, and prison inmate Smasher. They're out to get a psychopath who believes the world should have ended at the beginning of 2000 A.D. and is now determined to make that happen.

Many Sega Saturn owners didn't realize then how lucky they were that this game was cancelled on their system. Nintendo 64 owners were not so lucky, and I wasn't so lucky after getting the PlayStation version. The controls are sloppy, the hit detection is horrible, especially the dash attacks, and the character animation is almost jerky enough to look like an old claymation cartoon. If there is one redeeming factor, it is the music. Though not great, the musical scores in this game are a nice touch.

1510,"From the Great Wall of China to the canals of Venice, Tomb Raider II is the rare case in which a sequel is better than an original. In fact, I find this game to be my favorite of the series. In it the legendary Lara Croft sets out to find the Dagger of Xion. In her quest she navigates the globe, and even takes a couple of trips to strange and magical new worlds. Tomb Raider II offers significant improvements over the original, and its game play exceeds the other games that follow in the series. The game has drastically overhauled weapons and artificial intelligence. Though the puzzles are not as hard as later versions, they still are quite difficult. Lara has new moves, many new weapons, and more dangerous foes. What more could a Tomb Raider fan - or even the casual gamer - ask for? I highly recommend this game, whether you are an avid Tomb Raider fan or somebody new to the series. I don't believe you will be disappointed - in fact, you will probably find many hours of action filled entertainment. And if you do enjoy it, I strongly recommend other games in this series.",1,"From the Great Wall of China to the canals of Venice, Tomb Raider II is the rare case in which a sequel is better than an original.

1513,"This was another three dollar find in a bin at the resale shop.  When I was a kid I loved watching my friends or my brother's friends play this game and many other PS1 games that would later be heralded as classics.  I really didn't enjoy playing the games myself, because even my pre teen self in the mid 90s knew that the controls were absolute garbage.  Here I am twenty years later trying this classic again, and my opinion hasn't changed. I can't say much about the game because I can't make it further than the first screen on the first board of the game.  You're thrown down in a little cave at the beginning, and your first task is to blindly shoot at a couple of animals who were just minding their own business.  Then you have to find a way out vertically. The first jump you have to make in this game is ridiculous.  You have to make it to the adjacent rock.  There is a wall to your right preventing you from making a clean jump which also makes the camera go nuts.  Be prepared to make a lot of blind jumps.  It took me twenty minutes to jump to that rock which I promptly fell off.  Another ten minutes go by and I made that jump and got a little further up until I slid off a rock and all the way back down due to the horrible camera angle.  I actually tried to break the controller in half.  I have never been so mad at a game. So there you have it, that is my review.  I couldn't make it further than the first screen.  If you want a classic tomb raiding experience that you may actually enjoy, check out Tomb Raider Anniversary.  It's a blast, and I actually finished that game.",0,"This was another three dollar find in a bin at the resale shop.

I then pulled them out, put the lids on, which was not difficult and let them set for a few days. It might have taken less time but I didn't need them right away.

1555,"I recently started re-playing this game to find that it is actually quite fun. I remember first playing this game when i was a little kid at my friends house but never gave it any attention. I just thought of it to be boring and hard. But since i remembered it, i sadly asked him if i could borrow it and he said sure, keep it. So i did. Anyways, when i started it up, i remembered everything about the first mission, very hard especially without anymore ps1 memory cards. When i finally beat the first mission. ""The Wall"" It sadly took me hours, because after those tumbling rocks after you, you got ran over easy and died. Every time you die you have to restart the whole mission, so this is what took me the most time. Soon i got on to the second mission, i got pretty far but then the disc ""old and scratched up"" quit on me. It kept freezing. I have had this problem many times before on the first mission, so i had to restart it back up again. After that i pretty much quit. This is why i keep all of my games in their cases. So they will work about 10 years later. Sorry for such a bad review but later i looked up online and watched the whole thing, well the missions in speedy time. And saw how good the game layouts and graphics were. I really enjoyed this game, well the first couple missions of it. So maybe i will buy a ps1 memory card and start to savin' soon.",0,"I recently started re-playing this game to find that it is actually quite fun.

1567,"The first Tomb Raider was a classic in terms of its 3D gameplay, sense of exploration through massive levels, and a unique main character.  The 2nd installment in the TR series is not much different.  The levels are still HUGE, and exploration is still the name of the game.  But this time around, the environments and enemies are more varied, there are more action-based enemy sequences than the first, and the difficulty level has been approriately increased.  In terms of the level of challenge, I feel that this is the best in the series.  The later Tomb Raider series felt frustrating and downright cheap at times.  This one is definitely not a cakewalk, but is very possible without a strategy guide.  You don't feel as though you have to play for half an hour just to get into the next room.  Progress is slow, but steady, and you don't ever need 6 or 7 different items to move on.  Progress is more based on actually getting where you want to go rather than finding the right items or hitting the right combination of switches.  Some of the level designs are incredible, such as the Venice-based levels, the Opera House, the beastly Barkhang Monestary and the massive Temple Of Xian.  This is the key strength of the first two TR installments, and why the more recent ones have been less inspiring.  Resourcefulness and attention to the environment is extremely key, as medipacks are in light supply in this game.  Also, every level has 3 secrets in the form of dragons.  You do not receive the bonus items unless you find all 3 dragons in the level, making exploration even more vital in building your inventory.  Finding at least 2 of the dragons in every level should be quite easy, but some levels have one especially well-hidden dragon.  The gold dragons in the first two levels are remarkably difficult, but the reward of finding them (especially the first one) is worth it.  If you didn't like the first Tomb Raider, this game won't change your mind.  If you were blown away by the first installment (or even the 3rd, 4th or 5th) then this game is a real treat.",1,"The first Tomb Raider was a classic in terms of its 3D gameplay, sense of exploration through massive levels, and a unique main character.

1570,"Tomb Raider 2 is my absolute favourite PlayStation game of all-time! I bought the game in December 1997, around the same time I got my PlayStation. But I never really liked Tomb Raider 2 and only managed to get halfway through the first level, before forgetting about it for a while. Four years later, in the summer of 2001, I dug it out again and decided to give it a go with the help of a strategy guide. What a shock I got! After the phenomenal, worldwide success of the original Tomb Raider in November 1996, the Eidos Interactive guys put together the sequel, which, in a rare case, surpasses the original with flying colours. To save the game in the first, you had to find a crystal before continuing, wheras in Tomb Raider 2 you have the ability to save the game whenever you feel like. This comes as a great help, especially before taking off into a running jump over deep caverns and steep slopes. Lara also has much greater weaponary comapred to the last game. The first game featured Pistols, Shotgun and Uzis - that was about it. But with this game, you get weapons such as the Grenade Launcher and an M-16 Assault Rifle. While Tomb Raider 1 focused more on enemies in animal form, Tomb Raider 2 has a more worldly feel because the foes are mostly human. But the most notable change on Tomb Raider 2 is the welcome addition of vehicles. Tomb Raider featured none what so ever, but Tomb Raider 2 has a wide variety from the enjoyable speedboat in Venice and the snowmobile in Tibetian Foothills. Lara also took advantage of a make-over. The graphics where background scenery is concerned is still the same as the first game, but Lara herself has changed a lot; her hair is no longer tied in a bun, but flows freely down her back in a pony tail. The reason this wasn't featured in the first game is because the technology wasn't good enough for her hair to be in a pony tail - they couldn't get it to move in motion with her body (rather silly when you think about it now). Lara also possesses the ability to climb certain surfaces. The improved engine also served better lighting facilities, which allowed Ms Croft the ability to wield flares whenever she finds herself in dark areas. When it comes to the levels, the highlights are Venice, Offshore Rig, Tibetian Foothills (short but sweet - involves driving to one end of a road over pits to find a key, before driving all the way back to open a door that allows you to exit and begin the next level), Barkhang Monastery (HINT: Whatever you do, DON'T shoot the monks, they are here to help! They will dispatch any henchmen who try to kill you so you don't have to kill them! Accidently shoot one, and you'll have hundreds of monks trying to kill you!) and Temple of Xian. OVERALL GRADE: 10/10 Tomb Raider 2 is, in my opinion, the greatest PlayStation game there has ever been. Yes, the graphics are laughable now because they have come so far since - especially on the PlayStation 2 and X-Box, but it all boils down to how enjoyable the game is. And in that category, it is still the most enjoyable and exciting game ever. Hundreds of titles try to replicate the suspense and adventure that is seen in the Tomb Raider games and fail miserably.

However, the graphics do appear a bit fuzzy. The sound is decent, and the music even speeds up and intensifies when a character is near death. The second disc contains Street Fighter Alpha 2 Gold. The game is almost entirely identical to Street Fighter Alpha 2, with only a few differences. First, any character that was in Street Fighter 2 Champion Edition can switch between normal and Champion Edition modes. Playing a CE version of a character disables his super meter and changes a few moves here and there. The CE character graphics are still Alpha 2-style. Also, there is now an Akuma mode, which pits your character against Akuma over and over again instead of fighting all the other characters. Also, Cammy is hidden in the game. She appears in her X-Men vs. Street Fighter costume. All this is fine and good, but what about all the other great Street Fighter games? Where's SF2 Turbo: Hyper Fighting? Or the original SF2, complete with Guile's ""handcuffs"" and all the other weird little glitches?

1591,"Forgotten amidst the blood of Mortal Kombat and 3-D presentations of Virtua Fighter and Tekken, the Street Fighter II series initiated the fighting game craze.  Whereas its successors won their fanbases with graphical geegaws, Street Fighter II's strength was superb, well-balanced, uncomplicated gameplay that was simple to learn but exhausting to master.  Street Fighter Collection accurately reproduces that gameplay, making for an excellent anthology, but not a flawless one. Firstly, the omission of the first three iterations of Street Fighter II is glaring.  Given the lack of complexity of those games, one has to wonder if Capcom's developers were too lazy (or their marketers too greedy) to finish those titles for this release, instead leaving them for Street Fighter Collection II.  Graphically the games are preserved admirably, although CD audio forces the game to start each track over when speeding the tempo up, unlike in the arcade games.  The long load times are excruciating, as is each title requiring its own Memory Card block, when the high scores for both titles could easily fit into a single block. The inclusion of Street Fighter Alpha 2 Gold is nice, but seems out of place in what is supposedly a historical collection.  Perhaps the developers felt they rushed the original Street Fighter Alpha 2 to market, and tried to save face by placing the more polished Gold version in this compilation.  And since this third title requires its own Memory Card block, Street Fighter Collection actually requires three blocks in all, not one as is advertised on the packaging. Still, all three games have withstood the test of time, and are worth purchasing for gameplay if not historical value.  But the aforementioned drawbacks of the Street Fighter II games and dubious packaging do detract from the compilation as a whole.",1,"Forgotten amidst the blood of Mortal Kombat and 3-D presentations of Virtua Fighter and Tekken, the Street Fighter II series initiated the fighting game craze.

1599,"When I first got this game, I found it to be boring not too soon after getting it. When I play it today, I still think it's boring! WWF War Zone is the first real WWF wrestling game to be released on the Playstation. I don't really consider the In Your House game to be wrestling wise, but more Mortal Kombat like. War Zone is based off the WWF roster from late 1997 to early 1998, featuring only the most popular stars in the game . Among the wrestlers in this game, you can choose to play as Stone Cold Steve Austin, Shawn Michaels, Bret Hart, The Undertaker, The Rock, Triple H, Mankind, Goldust, Owen Hart, Ahmed Johnson, Farrooq, British Bulldog, Ken Shamrock, and The Headbangers. The opening of the game is cool, as you're given a Raw like intro that used to open Monday Night Raw back in the mid to late 90s. From there on, you're taken to the menu screen that's in the form of an elevator. In the menu you can look at the wrestlers' biographies that let you listen to their theme and see their attires they wear in the game. There's also a Training mode on the menu that lets you pick a wrestler and learn how to perform their moves before you go into the game. Once you enter the game, you can either play Exhibition matches to get adjusted to everything or go straight to Challenge Mode. Among the match types available are Singles, Tag Team, Tornado Tag Team, Hardcore, or Steel Cage. The Steel Cage match is probably the most frustrating match to play. When you climb the cage, I didn't know what button to push to climb down. I pushed down but I just ended up climbing back down to the ring. I lost most of the Cage matches. Challenge Mode involves you choosing a superstar to play as and guide them to the World Championship. Unfortunately this was a boring and irritating mode to play. Once you play one match, you've played them all. You have to fight the same opponents at least 4 or 5 times before you advance to newer ones. As you progress through, you'll be met by a woman in a limo in the parking lot who will either show interest you for winning a match or insult you for losing a match. Oh yeah, that's another thing. If you lose 1 or 2 matches, you're automatically sent back to the beginning and have to start over from match 1 to go up. It ultimately screws you over and you're forced to play a lot of the same boring matches again. Overall: I found War Zone boring then and I find it boring now. In my opinion In Your House is more fun to play than this. Even the sequel game to War Zone, Attitude, is more fun to play than War Zone.

1604,"I *hate* this game.  Let me state right away: graphics in a WWE wrestling game mean absolutely NOTHING to me.  The graphics in WWF War Zone are pretty good (and original, back in the day) but who cares?  It seems the only thing wrestling video game fans today are interested in is looking at their television set in amazement because the wrestlers look realistic, and their movements true to life.  Who cares?  When War Zone first hit the scene in the late 90's yeah, the graphics WERE cool.  Not now, especially when the only thing the WWE cares about these days is impressing gamers with realism. You know, WWF War Zone was the very first game that brought the graphics to a whole new 3D level.  A whole new level of crap.  You see, it makes me sick that the WWE wrestling games for 10 years now are all basically the same.  Let me explain why this is a bad thing. You know when you buy an updated sports video game (such as football or hockey) and the only thing different about it from the previous year are a couple new player names, and maybe some new options here and there?  That's exactly what the WWE has done with their video games.  For the last 10 years all the WWE games have been WAY too similar to each other, and it completely sucks out the fun when every new wrestling game that hits the market only offers a slight difference over the previous years game. It doesn't matter if it's Smackdown, Smackdown 2, WWE Raw for the Xbox, WWE Wrestlemania for the Gamecube, etc.  Those games are all the same- a lousy attempt to impress gaming and wrestling fans with realism.  I'm all for realism, but it DOES NOT MATTER in a wrestling game.  A wrestling game is like any other video game in that it SHOULD be all about having fun with it.  And I can't have fun with a wrestling game released today that, more or less, is exactly the same as a wrestling game from 10 years ago.  It makes me sick to think 10 years later, hardly anything has changed in the world of wrestling video games. Before WWF War Zone, you had WWF In Your House which, to this day, is a game that completely stands apart from other WWE wrestling games (along with WWF Wrestlemania: The Arcade Game).  Before those games you had the button-smashing delight of WWF Raw on the Super NES and Sega Genesis.  Once again, the formula in those old-school wrestling games didn't stick around and overstay its welcome.  Over 10 years with games just like WWF War Zone IS too much. The very second WWF War Zone came out on the Playstation and N64, it all went wrong.  Game companies got the idea that people wanted realism in their wrestling games, so from that point on ALL the WWE games had to be about having realistic-looking gameplay and wrestler appearances, and the fun factor washed away like sandcastles on the beach.  It's hard to have fun with a game when the year before you were playing the same thing.  After a while you get sick of it. WWF War Zone is an innovative game for taking wrestling to new heights, but it was the WORST thing that could have happened.  Graphically, WWF War Zone is the first of its kind.  Being the first means it's bound to have some flaws (despite the fact that existing is its biggest flaw!)  Another MAJOR problem with the game is how SLOW it is.  After the adrenaline-rushing WWF In Your House, we now experience wrestlers walking around in the ring VERY slowly.  Painfully slow, in fact.  Going from WWF In Your House to WWF War Zone is like going from a cheetah race to a snail race.  Your grandparents can wrestle each other faster than the wrestlers in this game.  To be fair, the ONLY thing WWF wrestling games today have improved is the speed.  Everything else is the same as it was 10 years ago. WWF War Zone also started the popular ""create a wrestler"" mode.  But it doesn't matter because, as I mention above, wrestling games for 10 years have had that option.  It's an option that has lost its charm because of overkill, and it's time game companies got rid of it, or did something to drastically change it.  It was a fun and interesting idea at first but now, 10 years later, I don't want to have it in a wrestling game ever again. I tried getting rid of WWF War Zone at a yard sale but no one wanted it, so I had to get rid of it by throwing it away.  No way was I keeping such a crappy game in the same shelf with MUCH more deserving Playstation games. If only WWE was more innovative with their wrestling games today, instead of repeating the same formula every year, I wouldn't have to keep going back and pointing out WWF War Zone as the game where the downfall began.

1607,"Kartia: ""The Word Of Fate"" (recognized as Rebus in Japan), crams  fabulous innovation in one decent Strategy/RPG. Although Atlus has released  a few worthy games on the PlayStation console, Atlus begins to grow as a  company who'll soon promote their selves into a house-hold name. Like the  arising empire of Enix. Despite the humiliation from their most  embarrassing game, Eggs of Steel, Atlus is gaining momentum with their  not-notch RPGs.  Taking corresponding steps alike with Ogre Tactics and  my all time precious- Final Fantasy Tactics-, Kartia packs  charming  innovations. Sure, Kartia may not have the excellent job systems like FFT,  or any archers for the matter, yet it brings temples of innovations to bury  the burden. It has Phantoms. Once the player ons his PlayStation, the  player selects his  decision to accept the role of Toxe or Lacryma. Each  character has a totally different story process.  The niddy-griddy fun in  Kartia is concentrating on your arsenal of Phantoms. They are  paper-rock-scissors monsters.  All phantoms can be defeated by a specific  one and vise versa.  Phantoms play the most basic role.  During the game,  the player uses them to create elemental magic or specialize weapons.  Assembling the player's own infantry takes a critical job for victory or  instant death. The objectives in Kartia are alike with FFT's system. From  claiming the lives of your adversaries to escorting a vital character,  Kartia has the same fundamentals of any Strategy/RPG game.  What really  amazes, is the addition to disturb the environment. Players have the  opportunity to cut down trees down for a bridge and order a magician to  freeze a pool of water for walking.  Battling enemies on the vast  terrain is exciting, but the game loses some valuable points from being  completely linear. Gladly, there is another innovation that covers that  burden as well, the 2P Mode. Final Fantasy Tactics could have been truly  flawless if Square decided to include the 2P Mode. Kartia takes  Strategy/RPGs deeper. The 2P Mode allows two players to battle their armies  on saved data. Players can also trade items.  The ONLY downslope going  for Kartia is the abrupt end.  Kartia is an engrossing story. With  a tale like this, why not bring an anime in the movie industry?  Both  characters have dissimilar story progressions. Loxe is a young boy who  enjoys the elegance of swordplay a bit too much. Lacryma is an incredibly  robust Shrine Knight. It's up to these two heroes to protect the land from  barbaric rebels. Heroes fighting the bad rebels may sound dull and boring,  but once the backstabs roll in, there's no way the player can let the  controller free again. Someone, anyone, make Kartia an anime!  Graphically Kartia is a 3D splendor. The vibrant colors hold an artistic  environment. When a person speaks, a dialogue box is set above the screen  and the character's faces appear. At the FMV department, the videos are  dark, and morbid that triumphantly stimulates your daily dose of eye-candy.  Music thrives to hand the player spectacular soundings.  The beats can  really adjure you in an edge of your seat thrill.  Atlus has succeeded to  create a game that goes beyond the redundant  RPGs today.  Don't be fooled  by Kartia's age or lack of popularity. This is a solid buy.  FFT fans, run-  kill only if necessary- to grab a hold of this monster.  2P mode shines and  awaits for your arrival. In return for your forty bucks you'll get the  chance to trade items with a friend, and get sucked into a extremely  addictive play!",1,"Kartia: ""The Word Of Fate"" (recognized as Rebus in Japan), crams  fabulous innovation in one decent Strategy/RPG.

What really  amazes, is the addition to disturb the environment. Players have the  opportunity to cut down trees down for a bridge and order a magician to  freeze a pool of water for walking.  Battling enemies on the vast  terrain is exciting, but the game loses some valuable points from being  completely linear. Gladly, there is another innovation that covers that  burden as well, the 2P Mode. Final Fantasy Tactics could have been truly  flawless if Square decided to include the 2P Mode. Kartia takes  Strategy/RPGs deeper. The 2P Mode allows two players to battle their armies  on saved data. Players can also trade items.  The ONLY downslope going  for Kartia is the abrupt end.  Kartia is an engrossing story. With  a tale like this, why not bring an anime in the movie industry?  Both  characters have dissimilar story progressions. Loxe is a young boy who  enjoys the elegance of swordplay a bit too much. Lacryma is an incredibly  robust Shrine Knight. It's up to these two heroes to protect the land from  barbaric rebels. Heroes fighting the bad rebels may sound dull and boring,  but once the backstabs roll in, there's no way the player can let the  controller free again. Someone, anyone, make Kartia an anime!  Graphically Kartia is a 3D splendor. The vibrant colors hold an artistic  environment. When a person speaks, a dialogue box is set above the screen  and the character's faces appear. At the FMV department, the videos are  dark, and morbid that triumphantly stimulates your daily dose of eye-candy.  Music thrives to hand the player spectacular soundings.  The beats can  really adjure you in an edge of your seat thrill.  Atlus has succeeded to  create a game that goes beyond the redundant  RPGs today.  Don't be fooled  by Kartia's age or lack of popularity. This is a solid buy.  FFT fans, run-  kill only if necessary- to grab a hold of this monster.  2P mode shines and  awaits for your arrival. In return for your forty bucks you'll get the  chance to trade items with a friend, and get sucked into a extremely  addictive play!"

1609,"The Little Engine That Could is most certainly apart of that elite group of books which make up the cannon of childrens literature and rightfully so.  This story, and various versions of it, have been around a long, long time and the message it holds is as pertinent today as it was when this story was first conceived. While Watty Piper in most generally given credit for the writing of this wonderful little book, the story was actually first conceived in 1906 under the title Thinking One Can, and was meant to be a Sunday School Story.  It was later published under the title of The Pony Engine, in 1920.  After morphing through several versions and several titles, it was finally published in 1930 by Watty piper which was a pseudonym for the publisher.  Since that time this little and wonderful story had continued to change in detail and even films have been made.  The message throughout the years though has remained the same. Now this newest version, the one being reviewed here is indeed different than the original and the story has been snipped and changed here and there and the art work is most certainly different.  Now I am a traditionalist when it comes to such works and normally I would go into a rant at this point in my review.  Not so in this case.  I picked this one up at the library and despite the changes; I found it to be a very well done little book.

This smaller, 1-ounce size was much better for meeting my needs. Luckily, Tupperware makes their products so that the same size lids will sometimes work on similar containers, depending on the size of the lip of the container.

By combining these two products, the mission was accomplished!  Note - I plan to re-post this review, with minor variations, on these two other product pages, so if you see it over there, you won't need to re-read the details. Any Tupperware container with a round lid is leak proof, so you can fill them up with small quantities of shampoo, conditioner, mouthwash, toothpaste, etc., and take them on the road, without worrying about leaks.  I have NEVER had a problem with a leak from a Tupperware container with a round lip.  As an added bonus, the containers have a lot of uses.  You can use them to keep your spices fresh.  My mom used to use them to store Wilton icing coloring dyes. They would be good for small quantities of craft products.  They are perfect for maintaining order over the small things that get thrown into a junk drawer.  These things are handy, so this list could go on and on. From my experience with Tupperware, sometimes the lids are a bit tight-fitting when they are new.  If you soak the lid in hot water for a couple of minutes, it will expand slightly, and will easily fit onto the container.  You should only need to do this one or two times; after that, they should fit without pre-soaking. Color - 2 stars The color is ugly, and I would not call it pink.  It is more of a watered-down version of a coral-like (or maybe salmon-like) tint than pink.  When I saw the color on the computer screen, I thought the color difference between my idea of pink and the reality would be chalked up to the virtual world.  But the reality was worse than the monitor.  :p  Saying this color is ""pink"" isn't even as accurate as saying that ""aquamarine"" is ""green"" or ""blue.""  I'm glad I didn't plan to keep these out on the table. Value Analysis - 3 stars In the past, it was always been worth paying a little extra for Tupperware because of the superior quality of the Tupperware brand, as well as the lifetime guarantee.  With this order, however, I noticed that the plastic feels slightly thinner and more brittle than the Tupperware containers I bought 20 years ago.  I actually took some of the older containers out and did a side-by-side comparison, and I liked the older ones better.  I'm afraid the containers may not be as durable as they used to be, but they still seem to be very durable.  Tupperware is still superior to most plastics, but the quality of Rubbermaid has improved over the years, and Rubbermaid is much less expensive.  If my Rubbermaid fails, I just throw it out and buy a new one. When I have used the warranty, it has provided a needed replacement for a favorite piece of plastic, and I've been very pleased with the results.  Balance this against the fact that, if I want to return a Tupperware product that fails, I have to pay shipping to send it back to them.  This is often just as expensive as the cost of the item being replaced.  I also have to pay shipping and handling for them to send the replacement back to me.  According to their web site, this is currently (May 2013) a flat rate of $5.75.  (And this assumes that the item can still be replaced, and you don't end up with a substitute.  You may wind up with a replacement of a different color, so the set you have no longer matches.)  I have a few pieces of Tupperware that need to be replaced, but have decided it's just not economical to do so.  So the pieces sit there in the back of the closet while I wait for the pile to grow large enough to make it worth the cost of sending them in and getting them replaced.  I have tried to convince myself to just throw them out, but they don't take up much room. ;) Is Tupperware worth the extra cost?  Yes, but only for especially useful and/or unique pieces.

Now in my biased opinion, I love snowboarding games, and this one was a classic among my friends and me. I recently played it again and noticed several pros and cons that made it such a good game. It had hilarious sound effects, great controls, a few varieties of boards to chose from, and solid looking graphics. It is also fun to get power ups and shoot down your friends to get in the lead. What's really cool about this game is the chair lift at the end of the run. To get back to the top of the mountain you have to go up a chairlift, but the chaos that happens to be the first person to ride the chairlift is hilarious. The only thing that turns people off from the game is that there are only four riders to choose from, and they're all little kids. In other games like Mario Kart, there is more characters to chose from, but the character choices are only a minor con. It also has an incredibly babyish look towards it that can be a slight turn off for older kids.  But once you can ""read past its cover"" the game can be so much fun to play with friends and family. It is almost nothing like the immature style the game gives off.

If two racers have a good lead on opponents but are trying to bump each other out of the way to jump on the next lift chair, it can give other people a chance to catch up and possibly sneak onto a chair first if their opponents knocked each other over.

1630,"These are great containers. At first, I was very disappointed in how poorly of a fit the lid and container were. But I decided to try them anyway, and proceeded to sanitize them properly. Being a chef for six years has taught me many things. One of which, you should always boil new plastic containers for at least a minute (best at 5 minutes) to remove any contaminants from manufacturing. We get enough plastics and other chemicals in our diets already. And if you are buying for your kid's lunches like I did, you should do this purely for your family's sake. The trick to plastic containers with fitted lids is that after you boil them in plain tap water for at least one minute: 1. Remove from boiling water using a pair of tongs or a slotted spoon. 2. Tip the container/lid so most of the water drains back into the pot. 3. Immediately find it's matching container/lid from the pot, and after draining it as well, put the two pieces together. 4. Allow to cool. 5. The lid and container should now be a much better fit. They might still be snug, but should be much easier on your fingers. Don't take my word for it though. Please only try one at first to make sure it works as well for you as it does for me. I hope this helps everyone purchasing this product.",1,"These are great containers.

1632,"We stopped watching the series (lack of time) and so this was a nice way  to keep the excitement going. The game is good, perhaps a little  disorienting at first. I spent the first hour sitting at Craig Willmore's  desk, doing nothing :) Once you get the hang of it, though, it follows  quite nicely. Because you have so much freedom in navigation (you decide  where to go, but things won't happen until you come back to the right place  at the right time), it feels like the game is non-linear. In fact, it is  rather linear, although you have a few variations. I wasn't disappointed in  the ending, but not thrilled either, it didn't blow me away. We got stuck a  couple of times, but we managed to make it without a walkthrough in about a  week. The rule of this game is SAVE OFTEN. And organize your saves. Keep  the last save before you change CDs (they correspond roughly to major  developments). You might need to restart from there because you forgot to  do something crucial. Or because you died (I got killed a lot too). You  need lots of frequent saves, and a few less recent, and a few even less  recent not to have to restart from scratch if you believe you forgot  something at the beginning of the game. But overall, the storyline is quite  intuitive and you'll be fine if you make connections. Buy this game if  you like the series but you're not a fanatic (you'd be disappointed). And  you'll have a good time if you can stand occasionally being stuck and turn  it into a challenge rather than into a frustration.",1,"We stopped watching the series (lack of time) and so this was a nice way  to keep the excitement going.

1661,"Where to begin with this train wreck of a game.  Twisted Metal 3 is like an abomination that should have never been made.  989 ruined the whole spirit and everything that made Twisted Metal 2 one of the best games ever made.  The only thing I would give this sequel over the previous game was that the cars graphically look a little better.  The game is so frustrating from the controls that it makes it no fun to play.  Everything got worse instead of better. Story and Characters They brought back the taxi from the first game, added a grandma and a Flower Power 60's car.  Yeah not a lot else needs to be said all 3 suck.  They got rid of some of the fun characters from the 2nd game like Shadow and Mr. Slam for those 3 and changed some of the names probably a copyright issue between the companies.  Not a big deal but still why not just keep the names the same.  The story is pretty much the same but uses 3D graphics instead of the animation theme.  I personally thought the animation from 2 was great and added a lot of fun to the game.  I loved beating TM2 with each character to see the multiple endings.  This game is so frustrating you will get none of that same enjoyment from this game. Play Control Is ridiculous in this game it is way over responsive to the point where it is hard to even drive the vehicles.  Just driving over power ups seems like a chore to pickup when they should be easy.  The wonderful freeze element in TM2 does not work near as well in this game.  The play control in TM2 was outstanding, every vehicle was easy to learn and play.  Not so in this monstrosity. Stages & Backgrounds The stages and backgrounds seem cramped and you don't get the feel of exploration you did in the previous game.  The cars all stay pretty close to you, so you don't do much searching for opponents on the other end of stages.  Gone are the fun elements of Antarctica falling to pieces or environmental dangers such as Moscow or the ruins of Latin America surrounded by lava.  Instead you get Egypt, The North Pole, Washington DC, London and Tokyo.  None of which is very exciting. I found the background boring and uninspiring. Challenge This game is cheap as hell, but not in the way you would think.  Instead of all the cars fighting each other, it seems like all the opponents just gang up on you alone so the odds are always 4 to 1 or 5 to 1 instead of even.  When you get a few opponents life bars way down they run off looking for your health powerups, that's right they wimp out stop engaging and run for health before they start attacking you again.  When I first saw this in the game I thought you have to be kidding me.  What programmer would add that in.  It really ruins the gaming experience and is frustrating.  When I died in TM2 I was eager to start the stage over and get revenge on the car that destroyed me but that does not really happen in this game because it takes so much longer just to destroy an enemy car because they are running after health the whole time.  The bosses are pretty much the same I thought the final boss was not unoriginal. The radar in this game is not nearly as good as with the previous game making it hard to track your prey and see where they are at on the grid. Verdict Avoid this game like the plague.  The cars and graphics may look better but you will have a better time beating your head against a wall that playing this game.  the endings and stories are not as good, the play control is awful.  The challenge is way to high because of cheap tactics. The radar is not really helpful.  All in All it is the worst game in the series.

But reading occasionally (maybe once a month), I find it delightful. First of all, it features a train, toys and a circus. What more could you want? Personally, I could do with less of the clown (as in, not at all), but not everyone shares my quirk or phobia. And it is a sweet story with an easy-to-grasp point. Is there anyone who grew up before 1990 who can hear ""I think I can"" and not remember the engine? And the illustrations (again excepting the clown) are colorful and enjoyable. Overall, it is no wonder this book is a classic of children's literature.",0,"""The Little Engine that Could"" is another much maligned book.

Still a fun game and the only twisted metal with the inside the car view no saving to memory cards there was a short code for resuming your game later. Twisted Metal 2: Most fans will consider this to be the best twisted metal of all the final release with single track after this one the game changes its physics dramatically... Twisted Metal 3: In this installment twisted goes for a much more realistic driving feel for the cars. Now this isn't necessarily a bad thing but to most fans it just wasn't as fun. This was 989 studios first attempt to make a twisted metal game and fans trying out twisted metal for the first time tend to be the only fans that like 3 the best. However a few of the early twisted metal fans like 3 better but the game play turned off a large percentage of fans so this one is hit or miss try it you might like it best or you might not like it at all.  In the end 989 failure to appeal to a large amount of the fans of the franchise put twisted metals popularity into a downward spiral. Twisted Metal 4: This game still made by 989 studios and after twisted metal 3 alot of the people who would of liked this game were no longer interested in twisted metal this one goes back gameplay designed to be fast and fun.

I think it was this that makes or breaks the game if you found a car you enjoyed playing you would probably like twisted metal 4 if not then your likely to turn away from it and say its a bad game.  This game attempted to incorporate features that would make hands down the best twisted metal and to some it was.  This is the last twisted metal game for the playstation 1.

1736,"If you've made it to this point in your life without playing a Twisted Metal game, that's all right, we'll explain it to you. The trilogy is probably best described as a vehicular version of Midway's Mortal Kombat or else a James Cameron's Terminator take on a demolition derby. In it, a horde of over-the-top characters compete against each other in cars and trucks armed with missiles, freeze rays, and other assorted weapons of destruction. This time out, there are a few new cars and weapons, and you have an option to have a computer-controlled ally aide you in the tournament, though he always seems to be the first one blown up in the fight. The biggest change to the series though is that its developer has changed from SingleTrac (who've started a new, but like-minded, auto-combat series under the moniker Rogue Trip for GT Interactive) to 989 Studios, a Sony-owned development studio. This affects the game on nearly every level. Graphically, the game appears much differently from the previous titles in the line, though it's not necessarily improved. There are various shading and lighting effects at work, but the end result is somehow grainy and washed out. The title's soundtrack, which is comprised of songs by Rob Zombie and Pitch Shifter, is very fitting, but the supporting sound effects are very weak. For example, the machine gun sounds like a cap pistol and driving through water inexplicably sounds pretty similar to that. The game's much-touted new physics engine turns out pretty strange in function. The cars will now dip and roll upon collision, which sounds fantastic in theory, but in practice is fairly questionable since vehicles will often flip over after hitting a small curb or even a snowman. The collision detection is also highly suspect, as instances where you'll find yourself stuck on a ledge or halfway into a wall are frequent. It's very nice to have analog control this time, but the physics engine really works against it. The main downfall of Twisted Metal III though is its lackluster level design. Most of the stages are, if not modeled after, extremely reminiscent of levels from the first two games, and those that aren't are even more uninspired. The Washington level, for instance, is a long rectangular courtyard with a ramped area on one end and teleportation sphere (which sends vehicles to the ramped area) on the other. Snore. In the two player modes, the default horizontal split-screen runs into the same problem found in SingleTrac's Rogue Trip. Since the levels are no longer as flat as in the previous TM games, having half you horizon cut away makes it hard to see in hilly or ramp-heavy levels. Fortunately, the designers had the foresight to include a wide variety of split-screen perspectives, such as a vertical cut and variations on a four-way split where the other two boxes are filled with radar, speedometer, and weapons info (these are the best since you view the world through a smaller version of the full screen). In the three- and four-player modes, the perspective is similarly cornered. Both appear to cut into the frame rate and increase the visible seams between surfaces, but not majorly. Multiple views aside though, the game is as much fun in multiplayer mode as it is in single player. As there, you'll be struck with the feelings of ""Why am I here?"" and ""Why am I playing this"" after a level or two. There are a few good ideas at work within Twisted Metal III (such as the multiple perspectives), but they're not nearly enough to counter the fact that improvements to the gameplay are pretty slight and the level design is a big step backwards, making the game a real lemon overall. If this is the direction the series is taking, it should probably stop right here.

1739,"I picked this up in a pack of two other N64 games for five dollars at a used game store. Now usually, those bundle deals have all of the mediocre N64 games in them that no one wants to buy individually. However, Star Wars: Rogue Squadron is easily one of the best N64 games I've ever played. Story: The game appears to take place between A New Hope and The Empire Strikes Back in the Star Wars universe. You're Luke Skywalker, the original trilogy's protagonist and a fighter pilot for the Rebel Alliance. You'll help people with vital intelligence defect from the Empire, protect Rebel-allied cities, and of course fight the Empire! Gameplay: Unfortunately, you never get to wield a light saber or anything. That's not what this game is about. It's a space-shooter. You travel to different planets in your X-wing or  one of the other Rebel spaceships and do missions. Sound: There may be an N64 game with more audio than Rogue Squadron, but I've never played it, if so (and I've played entirely too many of them :P). There's so much voice-acting. There's lengthy descriptions of every ship in the Rebel Fleet, backstories for Rogue Squadron's fighter pilots, and of course in-level communication between the pilots. Graphics: It's a very nice job by Factor 5, here. Of course it looks dated by now, but in the grand scheme of things, I'd say it's aged pretty gracefully. Make sure you have an expansion pack for your system to get the full effect. Replay Value: You get medals for doing well enough in every stage. I'm told that if you get medals in every stage, you can unlock secret missions like the Battle of Hoth from Empire Strikes back and the Death Star run. If that's not incentive to beat this game 100%, what is? It's clearly a classic N64 game, worthy of being mentioned in the same breath as Goldeneye64 and Ocarina of Time. I'd only that having a decent N64 analog helps.. a lot.

1747,"I was feeling nostalgic last week so I started playing Unreal again.  Probably for my third time through at this point!  While Unreal doesn't have as much replay value as a game like Half Life it certainly does have its moments!  Unreal was one of those really impressive FPS games for it's time.  It boasted great graphics and intense game play.  Of course by 2008's standards these graphics merely look silly!  But if you were picking this up in '98 like I was, you were pretty impressed. I figure I'll throw in some points about playing this on a more current system, since I experienced some issues here and there.  Being a game made for Windows 98 it doesn't translate perfectly over to an XP 32 bit system.  I have no idea what this would do on Vista's 64 bit architecture.  Basically when re-installing it I got a strange error with the option to ""ignore"".  You can definitely get away with doing that and then it will install fine.  Strangely every time you reinsert the disc to play some more you have to cancel out of the install process and that ""ignore"" message comes up as well.  I'm not sure if this is just my system, but I recommend saving quite frequently, at least every time you hit a ""load"" screen.  For some reason the game will randomly crash after a little while and it exits out completely for you.  This can be frustrating if you've been playing for a while, because it doesn't auto save between load screens.  Otherwise it played very smoothly on the newer system.  You can also get the Unreal Anthology which has been updated to handle Windows XP.  Oh and this was on a Pentium 4, 3.0 ghz system. That being said, I'll move onto the actual review for anyone thinking about delving into this great game for their first time.  The first thing you notice is that you have almost no health.  You begin to discover why as you start wandering around a crashed space ship and it appears you were some kind of prisoner.  Naturally the first things you need to do are finding some health and then find some way out of the ship.  The ship is kind of a boring part of the level, but it leads you a bit into the story line because you clearly crash landed on an alien planet.  When you finally get out of the ship the first thing you'll notice is how amazing and stunning the world is that has been created for you.  Outside it's very bright and vibrant in spots.  This felt a little different compared to games like Quake, Half Life, Doom, because a lot of those games are very dark and have a major dungeon crawl atmosphere to them.  Unreal has a lot of that usual stuff as well, but it also has a lot of time spent outside where you get to see amazing scenery.  One thing the developers did right was making you feel like the in game world was huge!  This was really impressive and fun when you first got into it. As you explore and interact with the world you learn more about what's going on with this planet called Na Pali.  Apparently the native people are called the Nali and they've been enslaved by an alien race called the Skaarj.  The Nali are extreme pacifists and I can't help but think their designers wanted them to be Buddhists for the most part.  The Skaarj on the other hand are the main enemy of the game, though not the only enemy creatures you'll face.  They are a warrior race that pretty much takes over wherever it sees fit.  You'll notice that the Skaarj design is clearly influenced by Predator.  They have a humanoid lizard design and have a mouth design that looks just like that of a Predator.  To brandish even MORE similarities they also have energy weapons and steel double claws attached to their arms.  As you can see this isn't very original.  Another part that is kind of unoriginal/strange is the Nali castles that you come across.  They are clearly living in what we would term a medieval level society versus the Skaarj who have high grade technology.  Strangely you come across large castles that look like they're straight out of thirteenth century England.  I know... strange for a race of pacifists.  Despite all this, those parts are some of the most fun to play through.  I loved going into the castles and running around! Another aspect that made Unreal very special, when compared to other FPS games, was the sheer amount of atmosphere that is injected into this game.  It truly does feel like you're on an alien world.  The sounds, the textures, were all there perfectly bringing you into this world, almost so much that you didn't want to leave!  You even hear echoes off of cliffs if you're walking through a cavern, it's like they tried to get as many little details in order to immerse the user.  For it's time the Unreal graphics engine was also very impressive and really took things up a notch in the gaming world.  They also programmed enemies to react more realistically to the user when confronted.  So when I'm fighting against the Skaarj enemies they will actually make an effort to jump out of the way of my shots.  This was really cool to see and I really only found that in games like Half Life. The maps you have to navigate through are pretty massive at times.  I really felt like a lot of the level design was also influenced by the great game Marathon.  A lot of times in order to open a door you have to search out a series of levers, or whatever, in order to proceed onto the next section.  This game literally has hours of game play and probably took me in the vicinity of 20 to 30 hours to complete, so you really get your moneys worth.  The downfall to having such large maps is it's kind of easy to get lost sometimes if you're trying to complete certain tasks.  Another detriment to the game was the lighting.  I put this game on maximum brightness levels in order to help me see where I was going.  Sometimes that wasn't even bright enough.  There are sections of this game that are absolutely dark, especially towards the end of the game.  While this creates a very scary atmosphere, I felt it hindered the game play once in a while.  The reason this hurts game play is because the flashlight function is incredibly annoying to deal with.  You have to pick up flashlights or flares in order to see in the pitch black areas.  Now to make it more realistic the flashlights eventually run out of batteries or something, but this was poorly incorporated because they only last a few minutes.  Seriously, the flashlights in real life would NOT die so quickly and then it's up to you to go find another one.  The only reason this hurts the game is because if you no longer have light, you can't enjoy the environment nearly as much. Aside from a couple flaws this is a pretty awesome game and I had a lot of fun playing it.  In '98 this came out around the same time as Half Life and they were both the must play FPS games that year.  Half Life ultimately won the game of the year slot mainly because of story line.  Unfortunately Unreal's story line is pretty poor in the greater scheme of things.  The user doesn't really feel a greater purpose to their mission and instead you are merely trying to complete levels and puzzles.  Whereas Half Life created a vastly well written world where you were trying to get out of a facility and stop an experiment gone out of control.  Unreal just couldn't compete with something of that caliber and it's not nearly as engrossing on that level.  Beautiful world and really fun to play overall, but not the best of the year.

Strangely you come across large castles that look like they're straight out of thirteenth century England.  I know... strange for a race of pacifists.  Despite all this, those parts are some of the most fun to play through.  I loved going into the castles and running around! Another aspect that made Unreal very special, when compared to other FPS games, was the sheer amount of atmosphere that is injected into this game.  It truly does feel like you're on an alien world.  The sounds, the textures, were all there perfectly bringing you into this world, almost so much that you didn't want to leave!  You even hear echoes off of cliffs if you're walking through a cavern, it's like they tried to get as many little details in order to immerse the user.  For it's time the Unreal graphics engine was also very impressive and really took things up a notch in the gaming world.  They also programmed enemies to react more realistically to the user when confronted.  So when I'm fighting against the Skaarj enemies they will actually make an effort to jump out of the way of my shots.  This was really cool to see and I really only found that in games like Half Life. The maps you have to navigate through are pretty massive at times.  I really felt like a lot of the level design was also influenced by the great game Marathon.  A lot of times in order to open a door you have to search out a series of levers, or whatever, in order to proceed onto the next section.  This game literally has hours of game play and probably took me in the vicinity of 20 to 30 hours to complete, so you really get your moneys worth.  The downfall to having such large maps is it's kind of easy to get lost sometimes if you're trying to complete certain tasks.  Another detriment to the game was the lighting.  I put this game on maximum brightness levels in order to help me see where I was going.  Sometimes that wasn't even bright enough.  There are sections of this game that are absolutely dark, especially towards the end of the game.  While this creates a very scary atmosphere, I felt it hindered the game play once in a while.  The reason this hurts game play is because the flashlight function is incredibly annoying to deal with.  You have to pick up flashlights or flares in order to see in the pitch black areas.  Now to make it more realistic the flashlights eventually run out of batteries or something, but this was poorly incorporated because they only last a few minutes.  Seriously, the flashlights in real life would NOT die so quickly and then it's up to you to go find another one.  The only reason this hurts the game is because if you no longer have light, you can't enjoy the environment nearly as much. Aside from a couple flaws this is a pretty awesome game and I had a lot of fun playing it.  In '98 this came out around the same time as Half Life and they were both the must play FPS games that year.  Half Life ultimately won the game of the year slot mainly because of story line.  Unfortunately Unreal's story line is pretty poor in the greater scheme of things.  The user doesn't really feel a greater purpose to their mission and instead you are merely trying to complete levels and puzzles.  Whereas Half Life created a vastly well written world where you were trying to get out of a facility and stop an experiment gone out of control.  Unreal just couldn't compete with something of that caliber and it's not nearly as engrossing on that level.  Beautiful world and really fun to play overall, but not the best of the year. Overall Rating: 4.5 out of 5"

1778,"I was never a really big fan of sci-fi, and Star Wars just wasn't my thing. I couldn't really care less about those darned rebels. Obviously, my expectations for Rogue Squadron that summer day were not very high. But you know what? I played the first mission and I was pleasantly surprised. The game actually wasn't that bad!  It was actually quite entertaining just flying around and shooting these drones out from the sky. The game really isn't that easy to learn, especially if you buy the game used without an instruction booklet. There are basically a lot of nooks and crannies that I have yet to figure out, like what right-C does, or how bombs work. But the introductory missions are fun and pretty easy. However, the gameplay got to be quite repetitive. I mean, you just go around and shoot enemies from the sky. Yay. There are also a lot of sections where you have nothing to do, and it gets boring. Maybe I could have moved on to the third mission. I also realized how visually stunning the game is. I have an Expansion Pak, so I really don't have a clue what the game would be like without it, but the graphics are just so crisp, at least certain features. The buildings and structures and ships and stuff look great, almost to the level of Half-Life. But the graphics for the people/Storm troopers leave more to be desired. They are obviously sprites. The music does have a Star Wars feel to it, and that's growing on me. I sometimes get certain tunes stuck in my head, and I don't mind. Most of the music is in the menus, though. 40 minutes of speech is nice, if only I could understand half of it. Rogue Squadron has no multiplayer, which is too bad. It would have been fun. Oh well. Overall, I actually kind of enjoyed this game.",0,"I was never a really big fan of sci-fi, and Star Wars just wasn't my thing. I couldn't really care less about those darned rebels. Obviously, my expectations for Rogue Squadron that summer day were not very high. But you know what? I played the first mission and I was pleasantly surprised. The game actually wasn't that bad!  It was actually quite entertaining just flying around and shooting these drones out from the sky. The game really isn't that easy to learn, especially if you buy the game used without an instruction booklet. There are basically a lot of nooks and crannies that I have yet to figure out, like what right-C does, or how bombs work. But the introductory missions are fun and pretty easy. However, the gameplay got to be quite repetitive. I mean, you just go around and shoot enemies from the sky. Yay. There are also a lot of sections where you have nothing to do, and it gets boring. Maybe I could have moved on to the third mission. I also realized how visually stunning the game is. I have an Expansion Pak, so I really don't have a clue what the game would be like without it, but the graphics are just so crisp, at least certain features. The buildings and structures and ships and stuff look great, almost to the level of Half-Life. But the graphics for the people/Storm troopers leave more to be desired. They are obviously sprites.

1781,"Having played the Twisted Metal series for a few years now, I can honestly say that Twisted Metal III, while having an initial gleam at first play, it wears itself out fairly quickly. The gleam I'm speaking of is the slick graphics and the incredibly different game play. It tries to be something new, which it is, but it improves in all the wrong ways. Allow me to explain : Weapons Inventory. Instead of a max capacity of the total number of weapons in your inventory, you are limited to how many of each weapon you can have. For example, I can pick up 10 homing missiles but no more. The rest of my inventory has to be stocked with other useless weapons like Speed Missiles (more on that in a bit). In previous TM installments, you could keep building your homing missile capacity, and carry only those, as long as you didn't exceed the max capacity. Annoying. New Weapons. Okay, so initially I thought the (((Rain Missile))) was the best thing since sliced bread. But really, the rain missile doesn't do very much apart from visual appeal. The missile shoots into the air and you detonate it, and a ring of fire falls down like five mini-napalms. It doesn't do the damage the napalm does, but only allows the cars to drive through so they start on fire...at least until they turbo (stop-drop-and-roll in TM maneuvers) out of it 2 seconds later. Minimal damage done. The introduction of the (((Speed missile))) was the worst mistake of the weapon category. It's a fast missile that has the strength of three machine gun bullets. If you can fire them fast, you can do some damage, but they're so useless during combat that it really doesn't even matter. (((Remotes))) are plenty but do much less damage than in TM2. (((Freeze missiles))) (the left-right-up maneuver) do not hit enemies like they used to. It is much harder to freeze an enemy. This can be frustrating. Enemies. New characters are added, some are great, some not so great. Your enemies now have the A.I. that allows them to steal items from in front of you. If they need health, they will race you for it and take the health. This is especially frustrating when you are fighting Minion and you have one shot left to kill him and he quickly finds full health. *Cue controller hitting floor* The levels are not very large. Not much scenery and not much to discover. There's a few hidden places you can find to explore, but for the most part it's very limited. All in all, TM3 falls flat. The previous installments are much better both in game-play value, and in overall playability. If you can find this cheap, get it.

I wanted a strainer that met three standards: 1) is durable & easy to clean 2) dries easily (so I can put them away quickly after use) 3) wouldn't scratch my sink or counter tops These fit the bill; also, for the price, you get four colanders, which is great when you need to simultaneously drain hot and cold items, or multiple fragile fruits and veggies. The shape is wide & accessible, and not too tall for low-angled faucet heads. Also important, these colanders are finely-meshed, so even small items (including the tiny ball bearings I use to clean glass bottles) won't fall through. Because they dry quickly, I can leave nectarines or other fruit in them after rinsing without worrying.

Plus, another good thing about Unreal is  the multiplayer games where you can play against computer-controlled  opponents (bots).  Sounds good, right?  Wrong.  Unless you put the skill  level down nearly all the way, simply aiming a gun at the bot will cause it  to zig-zag in a way that is impossible to hit, all while shooting at you  with godlike aim!

1800,"LucasArts has really outdone itself with this great N64 game.  After Shadows of the Empire was released, it quickly became obvious that the best level in the game was the first level, where you are flying a Rebel Airspeeder during the Battle of Hoth.  LA decided to make a whole game using a similar concept, and Rogue Squadron was born.  You play as Luke Skywalker, leader of Rogue Squadron, a group of elite rebel pilots who roam the galaxy, making life difficult for the Empire and its minions.  You play through 16 basic missions, which together form a loose plot chronicling the adventures of Rogue Squadron during the time between the destruction of the first Death Star and The Empire Strikes Back.  The missions range from simple search-and-destroy missions, to escorting supply trains, to freeing rebel soldiers from Imperial prison facilities.  Along the way, you must learn to handle a variety of rebel craft, from the X-Wing to the Airspeeder.  Each craft has its own strengths and weaknesses, plus each craft has a special weapon, which means that you are required to use each craft on certain missions.  After you complete each mission, you may be awarded a bronze, silver, or gold medal based on your performance.  After completing a mission, you can move on to the next one, or else go back and try again to get a better score.  The game gives you a score summary after each mission, so you know right away which areaas you need to improve upon to get the gold. The look and feel of the game is excellent.  The graphics are superb, and the Expansion Pak boosts them to cinematic levels.  The sound is also excellent for a non-CD game, although the chatter from your squadron mates does get a little repetitive.  The game is contained within a 3D environment, giving the game a flight simulator-like feel.  The controls are pretty easy to get used to, though this DOES take a little practice.  Fortunately, the first couple of missions are pretty easy, so you get a good chance to get familiar with the controls.  The controls are the same for each ship, so you don't have to switch back and forth. As stated before, the first couple of missions are pretty simple and easy.  But, starting with about the fourth mission, they start to get REALLY tough, with multitudes of TIE fighters, missile turrets, and gun emplacements all doing their best to shoot you down.  Expect to die many times before mastering each mission.  Getting the gold medal on all 16 missions will definitely take a while. The game has a lot of nice bonus features as well.  As you complete missions and earn higher medals, three bonus missions will appear, plus you will gain access to new ships, including the Millenium Falcon and a captured Imperial TIE Interceptor.  There is also a passcode screen, allowing you to enter codes to unlock all sorts of interesting options, including a fourth bonus level and the Naboo Starfighter.  There is even a code to allow you to fly a Buick sedan against the Empire!  The codes themselves are pretty easy to get.  There are several sites on the Internet that have them. It's easy to get immersed in the 3D environment of this game.  Many's the time I've found myself leaning over to the left or right as I put my X-Wing through a tight turn.  For those who like flight simulator-type games, I would say that this is the best FS game on the N64.

The toys begin to flag down passing engines to take them the rest of the way.  Several engines refuse, but a little blue engine agrees to try, even though she has never pulled such a heavy load.  Through generous good will and tenacity she makes it over hill.

1850,I use to play this AGES ago and use to be pretty good. I started playing it again and I now found that the controls (at least for me) don't seem very forgiving. In order to do tricks you have to place the toggle in the exact correct place (at least pretty spot on). You also have to land in a specific position or else you crash (too many crashes makes it so you can't finish the race). The half-pipe mode is pretty decent though and can range from super easy to insanely hard. Overall a not so bad game for that time.,1,I use to play this AGES ago and use to be pretty good.

1853,"If you don't read anything else: If you find this game at a yard sale for $1.00 - $5.00 or online, then go ahead and get it, but in my opinion there are much better snow boarding games out for the N64, like ""Big Mountain 2000,"" ""Twisted Edge,"" or even ""Snowboard Kids"" or ""Snowboard Kids 2."" Now I know that this was the N64's first snowboarding game, so we shouldn't expect the Taj Mahal in video game form here, but having played the previous mentioned snowboarding games and then playing this, there are some things that I dislike about this game. First, landing your snowboard in this game is more based on luck than skill. First, you have to press the ""Z"" button when you land and secondly you can't move your control stick AT ALL when you are landing or your player is going to fall over because the board is on an angle on screen. That right there ruined the game for me because it sucked a lot of the fun right out of the game. Also, if you want to try to play this game, I recommend plugging in an N64 controller that has a joystick that is still very firm. I started playing with my usually controller, where the joystick is a little loose and I was pretty bad. Plugged in another controller with a firm joystick, got INSTANTLY BETTER controlling my character in the game! Second, if you bump a wall you fall over. There are other snowboarding games on the N64 that do that, but here it seemed really prevalent. Third, the music in this game is really annoying sounding. I liked the title track, but after that I was treated to songs that had people with high pitched or dull voices yelling the same things over and over again! I would have preffered just straight up instrumental music here. Fourth, I noticed that ""PRETTY MUCH"" the only way of winning a race against the computer player, was to take a short cut hidden in each course. Sure you could try to out board them, but if you mess up 2 or 3 times (hit a wall or wall over) FORGET WINNING!!! Fifth, when you enter the competition events, YOU ONLY GET SO MANY CONTINUES and let's say you are playing on easy (Where there are 4 tracks) and you want to quit the 3rd race because you know you are going to lose and don't want to waste a continue. So you go to select ""Restart"" from the pause menu. YOU ARE BACK ON THE FIRST COURSE AND HAVE TO DO EVERYTHING OVER AGAIN!!! AGGH!!! Sixth, I did some of the time attack modes, I believe that's the right name for it. I am not positive right now.) Anyway, you have to board through certain goals (They look like a traditional marathon finish line) and I am playing the one level and the goal was on a cliff above me, that I had no chance of getting on from where I was and time ran out and I lost! WHY WOULD THEY PUT SOMETHING LIKE THAT IN THE GAME!!! Put the goal lines where people have a good chance of getting to them. Not up on a cliff, that I could of went up on, 8 seconds ago, but now I am stuck!!! I loved the look of this game! That's why it was so hard for me to let go of the thought of getting fully into this game. I tried very hard to like this game, but I still couldn't bring myself to do that because of the mentioned above flaws. If you can overlook them, and you have the taste for snowboarding games you should be able to enjoy this game. Happy playing and thanks for reading!

There are 5 characters that you can use to race, and more of which you can unlock. since there are only 60 head to head course combinations, there are other things you can do, like trick or time attacks.   This can take a bit to get used to, as it can be boring for the single player.

1865,"I bought this heater months ago thinking that I would try it in between the seasons, but the winter season in GA was cut short and this unit stayed in box unopened, unused until this week. User friendliness gets 5 stars. Just removing the heater from the box, rip all the plastics off and plug it in. I set it in the 17' x 20' living room where it leads to open kitchen, hall way and the stair case. I wanted a heater I could use before I officially turn on the centralized heater which blasts through the entire house. This heater does the job. There is no annoying sound, no burning odor at the first time plugging it in as some previous posts suggested, I keep it on lower heat and never leave it on unattended ... meaning that the unit is ON when I am in the room where I could see it. I have 4 cats and I don't take any chance with any appliances whatsoever. Would my cats ever decide to jump or lean on it to cause it to tip and fall on the floor? Maybe. As far as I know, the unit has auto timer but not auto-shut off feature when and if it tips over. If you are looking for a heater with such feature to shut-off automatically as some other units being sold at much higher price, obviously this one is not for you. It all depends on what you are looking for in terms of buying a space heater. My budget to be spent for a heater was no more than $60 and I am glad I bought this Lasko model 5160. As soon as you turn it on, it starts disbursing warm air out but the enclosure seems to stay cool to touch.

The difficulty of the controls are a little more difficult than other snowboarding games and may take a little bit more time to master, but it's well worth it.

The tracks offer beautiful scenery, sometimes very big jumps, jumping over cars, and a lot more. The tricks and the stunts selection that you can perform is very reasonable. Although you can't go beyond 1080 degree turns, there are other tricks that you might not find in any other snowboarding game. 1080 also includes a Training mode, which includes two different sections, the halfpipe and a straight run with moguls. When you begin, you can turn into the left gate for the halfpipe to practice your tricks, or you can head into the right gate for a straight downhill run with moguls scattered all over. When you finish, you start back up at the main gate and you keep going until you decide to quit. 1080 also has a few secret riders and boards within the game.

I've probably played through it at least a dozen times as I just enjoy the story, how it unfolds, the characters you meet and the events that transpire that intertwines their stories together. Prior to this game, I was mostly into sports/FPS type games. An RPG (heck I didn't even know what that meant at the time) game was not even remotely on my list of games that were coming out that I wanted. A friend of mine where I was working at showed me a gamer mag that had a full rundown of this game. Indeed it seemed very impressive and the more he talked about it, the more I got interested in it. Then came release day. I still wasn't sold on it but after leaving work I figured... what the hell. Drove 45 minutes north to the nearest mall where a buddy mine worked at EBGames. Soon as I entered he was like ""Did you preorder this!!"". I told him no and that I wasn't really interested in RPG's as they always sound boring and I'd lose interest quick and waste my money. He showed me a quick demo and I admit, it got me thinking as to ""I wonder what happens after this..."". I finally said sure. He hooked me up with the strategy guide, free tshirt and the 3 disc game... 3 DISCS!! When I cracked open the case and saw 3 discs... I knew this would be an epic, legendary tale. I just didn't know how epic. I won't go much into the characters as they have been around a long time and most know who/what they are. But the story... wow. I could not have been more hooked. At first it started off a little slow, mostly to get you introduced to the characters and get some backstory going. After the 2nd mako reactor explosion and you get knocked into slums and fall through the church and meet Aeris... it all changes. The direction, tone and emotion starts running higher. Battles get more intense. You really get the feel that something big, much bigger than even all these characters is building up. It all seems to point to Shinra, but even as you infiltrate it, something is even more disturbing. JENOVA. Soon as I saw that short cutscene with Cloud peeking inside its stasis chamber.. my jaw dropped. I wanted to know what it is, where it came from, what they are using it for etc etc etc. But thats what set this game apart. The more answers you get, the more questions were raised than before. The world is huge, lots of explorable areas with side quests and storylines. I spent alot of time raising the Chocobos and racing them to get the Gold Choco so I can access the caves that contained important and powerful items and materia. Materia System: One of the best magic systems I have encountered to date. While you won't use all the materia you buy/find. Its the reward of seeing that glowing green/blue/red/yellow/purple stone that makes you fight to get it and see what it is. Summons are excellent with great animation for the time it was made. Knights of the Round was very long to summon, but the damage and wait is well worth it. Characters: Some of the most diverse ever seen and very deep with different backgrounds. I think the first time I really got a sense of how immense this story was getting was when I first went into Shinra Mansion with all the creepy creatures you fight and head into the basement where all the Shinra research was stored regarding JENOVA, Sephiroth and the experiments. The characters sucked you in with their drive and emotion to the situations. Making you want to keep going and see whats around the next corner. In conclusion, for us long-timers here this game never gets old. For the newcomers, get ready to experience something extraordinary. To quote the back of the Playstation case..

1886,"This game is very fun to play, but be warned off by this review from me!  It has the highly severe computer worm in its installation cds that Symantec's Norton web site refers to as: ""IRC W32 Tibick Activity"".  Also the XP update for it also has a computer worm in it! To check out the details off what it does to infected computer systems go to: [...] That page at Norton doesn't specifically refer to ""Final Fantasy VII"", but for those that want to know for sure that what I'm stating is correct you can use the shorter web site address at Norton by using the web address of: [...] In the web page that pops up into view; enter: ""Final Fantasy VII""  into the search box on that page and hit the enter key on your keyboard.  A page with three options will comeup.  The top one is about the worm in the FF VII installation cds.  The next one is about the XP 1.5 version upgrade, and that has an additional worm in it.  The final option refers to a worm that infects FF XI & FF XII.  That worm is even more dangerous than even the one on the FF VII installation cds.  Thast one will automatically go to the computer's  email section and send ZIP versions of itself to every contact listed there.  Also all three worms will every time the computer is turned on check for a specific website to get upgraded versions of itself. My advise though Norton doesn't state it; is to destroy every copy of the PC version of ""Final Fantasy VII"" that you have to prevent infecting the computers in the world. In the file about ""IRC W32 Tibick Activity"" the Norton people mention how to completely remove the computer worm from infected computer systems.  That process can take a while though as that worm infects several other programs on the computer as well.  Norton lists all the programs that it infects as well. I myself have two copies of FF VII and even a copy of the cds I made as well.  I'm going to destroy those cds as well to follow my own advise.  Those people sure did a very mean stunt to the makers of Final Fantasy VII in ruining possibly the best rpg game they ever made!!!  Personally I think those people at the least should be sent to a federal prision<sp> for the rest of their lives!!! grrr!!!",1,"This game is very fun to play, but be warned off by this review from me!

1887,"It smells like melting plastic when you run it for very long even on low heat.

1892,"This game is fantastic, and you won't be able to put it down for a long long time.  I have over 120+ hours played on my game save.  Final Fantasy VII Platinum Edition features a revamped old soundtrack...that I find 2x better than the PSone version's soundtrack.  Although it takes a while to adjust to the numpad controls, after playing for a while, you'll wonder how you would have done it any other way.  The on-screen controls are bizarre and during scenes such as the timed puzzle in the rocket ship, you'll have a hard time typing in key combos.  Materia allows you to use different magics on different characters, allowing for different characters to use Summons, Magic, and Cure.  My tip: don't give up solely because of the controls---this game is FANTASTIC and although I found the console experience more enthralling and easier to jump into, the PC version was much more cinematic and was totally worth it.  FF7 is by far the best game I have ever played, and you do not want to miss out on this adventure.  My only tip: don't save over the same file, especially before you enter the Northern Crater--you won't be able to exit it if you do. Replayability: ***** (Tons of extra caves, quests, missions, mini-games to find, extra materia, weapons, limit-breaks, and bosses to fight well after the game is over.) Gameplay: ***** (Amazing boss fights, you will be on the edge of your seat during battles, incredibly fun) Story: ***** (The plot twists, the depth in the story, the emotions...its AMAZING) Graphics: ***** (You can view on a big resolution, better textures and stuff.  More crisp than the PSone version) Controls: **** (Takes a while to get used to, you won't want to try another control setup once you do) Sound: ***** (Sound effects are recycled from the PSone game, BUT, the music was totally redone, and that is one of the biggest parts of this game) Addictiveness: ***** (I stopped playing my other games for almost 4 months when I got into this game) The best part of this game is that it is so easy to pick up and play.  The Ruby and Emerald Weapons provide you with more challenge than the last boss of the game.  Raising chocobos and minigames at the Golden Saucer couldn't be more fun, and this remains the only game besides World of Warcraft that I haven't uninstalled from my computer.  Final Fantasy VII is a keeper, and don't be discouraged by the prices on Amazon, by the time you're done with the game, you will believe it to be the best $50 you have spent on a game.

1907,"I loved this book as a child and I still remember my mother reading it to me vividly to this day.  She has since passed away, however, the underlying message of the book about having confidence in oneself stuck.  I think this theme of ""knowing you can do it"" is a value message for children to learn. I read through the story of the book and it had even more impact with the updated art.  The images are original, powerful and really bring the story to life.  I can see why they would appeal to children and the use of colors is amazing. I've read a few reviewers comments that the book is sexist.  I didn't notice that the ""bad trains"" were a certain gender and the ""good trains"" another when I read it.  However, I'm wondering if this just may be a coincidence.  I have a hard time believing the author of a classic like this with such a good underlying positive message would do something like this on purpose.  Ditto... for the editors who are watching out for problems like this.  While I could be wrong, I think Watty Piper deserves the benefit of the doubt and perhaps she will be open to making some editorial changes to correct an apparent sexist slant in future editions. I also found the large format and prints in this book a value add.  It is also printed on nice paper and lends itself to being used over and over.  This format also makes it good for reading to small groups where the children will need to see the pictures from a distance. The toys seemed to be almost alive to me.  The artwork was succesful in giving them some kind of personality.  They seem more than just stuffed animals and I think this quality will appeal and endear them to children. The art is so captivating that it almost distracts me from the story.  I have to admit I haven't read the classic version in a long time, but it seems to me there was more repetition of the core message in that version.  If my memory is faulty, I think it would be an improvement to repeat the ""I think I can.... I know I can...."" theme more often.

1925,"This is the first time that the 'Little Engine' has been published as a deluxe picture book. For this reason alone, it is unfair to compare it to the previous editions. The older editions are illustrated with small, simple, colored line drawings rather than lavish, full-page, full-color paintings. Long's illustrations are beautiful and, in my opinion, suit the story better than the old ones did. As I child, I was never quite sure if the clown and dolls were toys or people. Long's illustration makes them obviously toys. Long's illustrations give the different locomotives distinct looks and personalities. The original illustrations for both previous editions of the book have locomotives that are virtually identical, except for being different colors. The passenger engine in Long's illustration is a sleek, streamlined design with an arrogant, sneering expression, while the freight engine is a massive, dark iron, whale-like machine that looms over and peers down at the tiny clown. It's unfortunate that the review from the School Library Journal was chosen by Amazon for the Editorial Reviews, above. I'd like to correct some errors - the writer has her facts wrong about the history of this book. What Burg believes to be the original edition of the book is, in fact, the 1954 edition with illustrations by George and Doris Hauman. Although Burg praises the '1930s' look of these illustrations with the green poka-dotted clown, they scream '1950s!'. While most people today are familiar with this version, I think the older illustrations are showing their age, and I believe children today will relate better to Long's paintings. Also, as I have stated above, I believe Long's illustrations help tell the story better. The actual 1930s illustrations were colored line drawings by Lois Lenski, and few people today will have seen them. Interestingly, those illustrations show the story taking place in a stark, snow-covered winter landscape. Burg claims Loren Long's paintings have a '1950s' look. Anyone familiar with painting styles of the 1930s will recognize the influence of painters like Grant Wood on Long's style. Long's illustrations are much truer to the 1930s than the 1954 illustrations are.

1939,"My second daughter has now fallen in love with this book, at about the same age as her older sister did (3 and 1/2).  So, we are reading it every single night, often multiple times.  If her older sister is any guide, this will probably continue for about 6 months. This is simply an absolutely perfect children's story.  The plot has some tension to keep the child's interest to the end of the story.  The story shows how small people (or trains, if you want to be literal) with a good heart (like a child) can make a big difference in the world.  The illustrations are extremely colorful and magical.  The only fault (this is incredibly minor) I can find is the one-time usage of the word ""indignantly"", which no child is going to know.  Other than that, I wouldn't change any other word or aspect of this book. It's also a fun story for an adult to read outloud.  I enjoy using different voices for the arrogant Shiny New Engine, the gruff Freight Engine, and the tired Old Engine, as well as helpful Little Blue Engine's famous repetitive cadence (""I think I can"").

1967,"I don't go for adventure games, personally.  Ninety percent of the time, I prefer shooters.  But this one...man, it's so weird, so unique, and so GENIUS through and through, how can you not love it? Here's the story.  Manny Calavera is a low-level salesman trying to earn an honest commission and make a decent day's pay, but it never seems to work out for him.  His boss is constantly on his back, he's routinely snaked by a competitor, Domino Hurley, and the right sales never come his way.  It's a lousy life to have. Especially if you're already dead. That's the twist; Manny, and just about everyone else in the game, is dead.  This whole game takes place in the Land of the Dead of Mexican/Aztec folklore, with a strong Art Deco influence, with heavy doses of '30s crime noir thrown in.  Everyone in the game is fashioned to look like the sugar skeletons used in Day of the Dead festivals (called 'calaveras'; get it?). Manny works in the Department of Death, trying to work off his time for his misdeeds when he was alive.  He does that by trying to sell 'travel packages' to the recently deceased, so they can make their four-year journey across the Land of the Dead, until they reach the portal leading to the Land of Eternal Rest.  The quality of life this person lived determines whether they get to use a car, a luxury liner, or the exclusive No. 9 train, which speeds its passengers there in four minutes, instead of the customary four years. Unfortunately, the kind of lowlifes who keep coming Manny's way only deserve walking sticks at best, which does absolutely nothing to help Manny work off his time.  So, he decides to take matters into his own hands and STEAL the right kind of client. And that's when he gets in over his head. The story is pure crime noir with a technicolor twist, like Raymond Chandler meets Tim Burton.  The plot Manny uncovers is convoluted, brilliant, deeply twisted, and diabolical like you've never imagined possible.  It's also incredibly, unspeakably funny.  Tim Schaefer is one absurd individual, make no mistake. Yes, it's an old game, I know.  But the true classics know no age, and this is a classic all right.  So take advantage of the price, snap it up, and book a trip with your new favorite travel agent.  He's waiting for you...",1,"I don't go for adventure games, personally.

All while Manny pursues the love of his afterlife! Confused? Trust me, it will all make sense once you start playing and the dialog and graphics will impress you and keep you hooked. I've tried a lot of the adventure games and they all have their flaws. But Grim Fandango comes as close to perfect as any game ever will. The controls are a little irritating but not as much as some newer games. This is the best adventure game out there and I strongly recommend that you try it."
1971,"The remote control is a convenient feature if you're using it in a bed room. Bought this for the front of the house, which doesn't get that much heat.

One caveat: At least one puzzle seems to be tied to processor speed, so if you have a fast machine you'll need to download a patch from the manufacturers' website.

Everything is drawn in great detail right down to character traits and facial expressions (who would have thought a fleshless person would be so good with expressions.) The story is also very entertaining and added with the graphics, it makes this a very absorbing adventure. This is one of the few games that I can't say anything negative about.

Other than that the thermostat is very accurate. It said it has a 2 speed blower motor and that is true but only operates on one speed... I have not tested to see if the motor operates on high or low speed.,1,It has a poor design flaw. The squirrel cage blower is only 3/4 of the heater core size.

1989,"Grim Fandango will definitally be enjoyed by fans of film noir and mexican mythology. I'd give it a 4 and a half if i could. The graphics have their flaws and the game runs choppy on systems not far ahead of the system requirements. Some of the puzzles are utterly impossible to figure out without incredible luck or the aid of a stradegy guide but the game is truly astonishing. You follow the character Manny Calavera, a travel agent for the dead, guiding souls to their final resting place in the best way possible. For some reason, Manny is denied any premium clients. Whos behind all this? Find out over a 4 year journey from the dusty streets of El Marrow, to the edge of the world and back again. Absolutely beautiful backgrounds and film noir-ish music immerse you in the atmosphere. Clever interface and variable controls are great. A very involving game. Not too long not too short. Humor and wit are weaved through every scene. In conclusion, film noir style, surreal visuals, toe tapping and ensuing music, gripping story, charming characters, and challenging puzzles will intrigue all game fans.",0,"Grim Fandango will definitally be enjoyed by fans of film noir and mexican mythology.

It's just as deep and enthralling as any Final Fantasy should be. But, to be honest, it's a hassle to bother with the PC version. It's best to get a playstation and play it that way. FF7's system requirements are strict and tend to make the game look and run worse than on the Playstation even if you have a good computer. And keyboard control is no fun at all(ironically, I used a gamepad that resembles the PS controller).
